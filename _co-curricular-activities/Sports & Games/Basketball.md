### Introduction

“Scholar Sportsmen” is the motto of Yuan Ching Secondary School Basketball Team.

Each member of the basketball team always strive to achieve the best results in both academic and sport domain. Each member of the team are expected to encourage his fellow peers to excel both on and off the court.  

The team trains on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the school term. Selected students will train with added intensity during the school holidays to prepare them for National School Games Basketball Competition. The team also participates in other ad hoc competitions and friendly games throughout the year.

Secondary One students who are interested to join the Basketball CCA are selected based on their attitude, physical and technical abilities during trials conducted by the coach and teachers-in-charge. Those who make the cut for the CCA undergo a disciplined yet rewarding training regime under the close supervision of our teachers and coaches.

**VISION:** Every Basketballer, a Sportsman, a Scholar.

**MISSION:** To promote and provide developmentally appropriate basketball programmes for all CCA members which enhance their physical health, character development, and enjoyment of the sport in a safe environment.
