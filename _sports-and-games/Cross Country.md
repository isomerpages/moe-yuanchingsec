### Introduction

Yuan Ching Cross Country has a long history dating back from the 1980s. In the 1980s, the girls team dominated the National Inter-school Cross Country arena. In the recent years since the official revival of the CCA in 2016, the Cross Country ‘B’ Boys has made a remarkable improvement, achieving a commendable 17th and 11th team position in the National Inter-school Cross Country Championships 2014 and 2015 respectively.

In 2019, our Yuan Ching Cross Country team clinched their first National Inter-school Track and Field and National Inter-school Cross Country medals since the 1990s.
