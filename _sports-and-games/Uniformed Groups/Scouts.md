### Introduction

The Cougar Scouts in Yuan Ching Secondary School has had a long history since the late 1980s. The Scouting's purpose is to help young people to develop their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual capacities as individuals and as members of society. We aim to contribute to the society by rising to the occasion for National Events. Through equipping ourselves with core skills like Pioneering and Orienteering skills, our learning never stops.  

**VISION** <br>
Better Scouting for more young people.

**MISSION** <br>
To contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law. To help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society. This is achieved by:
*   involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational process
*   using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person
*   assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Scout Promise and Law

### CCA Activities
*   Annual Camp
*   Outdoor Cooking
*   Campfire

*   Value-In-Action â€“ initiated by the scouts
