<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Cougar Scouts in Yuan Ching Secondary School has had a long history
since the late 1980s. The Scouting's purpose is to help young people to
develop their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual
capacities as individuals and as members of society. We aim to contribute
to society by rising to the occasion for National Events. Through equipping
ourselves with core skills like Pioneering and Orienteering skills, our
learning never stops.</p>
<p><strong>VISION</strong> 
<br>Better Scouting for more young people.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION</strong> 
<br>To contribute to the education of young people, through a value system
based on the Scout Promise and Law. To help build a better world where
people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in
society. This is achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational
process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent
of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and
committed person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social
and personal principles as expressed in the Scout Promise and Law</p>
</li>
</ul>
