<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) is a National Uniformed Group
under the purview of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Home
Affairs, Singapore Civil Defence Force. NCDCC believes in developing and
empowering our youths to be active and concerned citizens with life-saving
skills. Yuan Ching Secondary School began its NCDCC journey in 2017, with
the focus to develop greater awareness of civil defence in our cadets and
prepare them with the skills to respond effectively to emergencies at home
and abroad. The attitude of readiness in face of adversity and practical
skills that are critical in times of danger and emergencies are life-long
capabilities that our young civil defence ambassadors will develop themselves
in.</p>
<p><strong>MOTTO</strong> 
<br>NCDCC’s motto of “We Learn, We Lead, We Serve”, in alignment to the 3
big ideas in Character and Citizenship Education: “Identity, Relationships
and Choices”, well encapsulates the journey of NCDCC cadets into the following
three phases:</p>
