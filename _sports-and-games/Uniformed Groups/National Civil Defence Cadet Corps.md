### Introduction

National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) is a National Uniformed Group under the purview of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore Civil Defence Force. NCDCC believes in developing and empowering our youths to be active and concerned citizens with life-saving skills. Yuan Ching Secondary School began its NCDCC journey in 2017, with the focus to develop greater awareness of civil defence in our cadets and prepare them with the skills to respond effectively to emergencies at home and abroad. The attitude of readiness in face of adversity and practical skills that are critical in times of danger and emergencies are life-long capabilities that our young civil defence ambassadors will develop themselves in.  


**MOTTO** <br>
NCDCC’s motto of “We Learn, We Lead, We Serve”, in alignment to the 3 big ideas in Character and Citizenship Education: “Identity, Relationships and Choices”, well encapsulates the journey of NCDCC cadets into the following three phases:
