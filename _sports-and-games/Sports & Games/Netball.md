<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Here at Yuan Ching Netball, we aim to develop disciplined, determined,
yet delightful athletes who are live examples of our school’s motto: efforts
today, rewards tomorrow. In pursuit of this ideal, our student athletes
participate in a range of activities to achieve a high fitness level as
well as optimal skillfulness in the game. We place a heavy emphasis on
essential fundamentals, such as physical training, essential ball-handling
skills, foot work and court work. Furthermore, we allow students the chance
to use these skills in various competitions, friendly matches and zonal
competitions. At the end of the day, our student athletes are also great
team players who can think quickly on their feet and adapt themselves to
any situation.</p>
<p>We provide plenty of opportunities for growth for our netball student
athletes in various capacities. Our student athletes develop leadership
skills through various events such as organization of VIA projects, matches
and events for the school. They are also given the chance to learn first
aid skills, as well as umpiring skills for netball matches. Whenever opportunities
arise, our members also support Netball games played by Team Singapore
or other international teams during Nations Cup and SEA Games, building
a sense of pride for both the sport and our nation.</p>
<p>As a team sport, we value togetherness, trust and teamwork above all.
We believe that the skills and values imparted to those who join us will
help develop kind and capable athletes who will find success and meaning
in their future endeavors.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VISION</strong>
