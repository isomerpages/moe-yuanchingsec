### Introduction

Netball members participate in a range of activities to achieve a high fitness level as well as optimal skillfulness in the game. This includes various physical training, essential ball-handling skills, foot work and court work. Members also learn to work together as a team and practice thinking on their feet when playing court games. As such, they will have opportunities to apply what they have learnt to friendly matches, carnivals and zonal competitions. Selected members will also learn first-aid and umpiring skills in Netball. During eCCA sessions, members focus on their basic footwork, ball handling, and physical fitness. They also participate in learning the theory and tactics of the game through games and quizzes.

During our Annual ‘Day Camp’ and Farewell for the Seniors, members bond with one another through games and circle time. Whenever opportunities arise, our members would be exposed as supporters to Netball games played by Team Singapore or other international teams during Nations Cup and SEA Games.

As a team sport, we emphasise on the importance of teamwork, character building, values and skills. We believe the values learnt and skills imparted to them during their growing years will go a long way to contribute to their successes in the VUCA world ahead.
