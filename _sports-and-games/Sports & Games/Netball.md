### Introduction

Here at Yuan Ching Netball, we aim to develop disciplined, determined, yet delightful athletes who are live examples of our schoolâ€™s motto: efforts today, rewards tomorrow. In pursuit of this ideal, our student athletes participate in a range of activities to achieve a high fitness level as well as optimal skillfulness in the game. We place a heavy emphasis on essential fundamentals, such as physical training, essential ball-handling skills, foot work and court work. Furthermore, we allow students the chance to use these skills in various competitions, friendly matches and zonal competitions. At the end of the day, our student athletes are also great team players who can think quickly on their feet and adapt themselves to any situation. <br>

We provide plenty of opportunities for growth for our netball student athletes in various capacities. Our student athletes develop leadership skills through various events such as organization of VIA projects, matches and events for the school. They are also given the chance to learn first aid skills, as well as umpiring skills for netball matches. Whenever opportunities arise, our members also support Netball games played by Team Singapore or other international teams during Nations Cup and SEA Games, building a sense of pride for both the sport and our nation.<br>

As a team sport, we value togetherness, trust and teamwork above all. We believe that the skills and values imparted to those who join us will help develop kind and capable athletes who will find success and meaning in their future endeavors.



**VISION** <br>
Every Netballer, a disciplined achiever who contributes actively towards team and personal excellence.
