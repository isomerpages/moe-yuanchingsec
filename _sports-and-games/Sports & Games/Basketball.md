<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>“Scholar Sportsmen” is the motto of Yuan Ching Secondary School Basketball
Team.</p>
<p>Each member of the basketball team always strive to achieve the best results
in both academic and sport domain. Each member of the team are expected
to encourage his fellow peers to excel both on and off the court.</p>
<p>The team trains on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the school term. Selected
students will train with added intensity during the school holidays to
prepare them for National School Games Basketball Competition. The team
also participates in other ad hoc competitions and friendly games throughout
the year.</p>
<p>Secondary One students who are interested to join the Basketball CCA are
selected based on their attitude, physical and technical abilities during
trials conducted by the coach and teachers-in-charge. Those who make the
cut for the CCA undergo a disciplined yet rewarding training regime under
the close supervision of our teachers and coaches.</p>
<p><strong>VISION:</strong> Every Basketballer, a Sportsman, a Scholar.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION:</strong> To promote and provide developmentally appropriate
basketball programmes for all CCA members which enhance their physical
health, character development, and enjoyment of the sport in a safe environment.</p>
