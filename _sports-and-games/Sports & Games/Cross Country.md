<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Yuan Ching Cross Country has a long history dating back from the 1980s.
In the 1980s, the girls team dominated the National Inter-school Cross
Country arena. In the recent years since the official revival of the CCA
in 2016, the Cross Country ‘B’ Boys has made a remarkable improvement,
achieving a commendable 17th and 11th team position in the National Inter-school
Cross Country Championships 2014 and 2015 respectively.</p>
<p>In 2019, our Yuan Ching Cross Country team clinched their first National
Inter-school Track and Field and National Inter-school Cross Country medals
since the 1990s.</p>
<p>Besides the NSG Cross Country and Track &amp; Field Championships, the
CCA also took part in events organised by external organisations, such
as the Wings Athletics Cross Country, SA All-Comers Meet, Taman Jurong
Homerun &amp; Pocari Sweat Run in recent years.</p>
<p></p>
