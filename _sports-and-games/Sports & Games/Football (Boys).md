### Introduction

Football CCA is one of the Physical Sports CCAs in Yuan Ching Secondary. Each year we take in an average of 15-18 boys after highly competitive selection trials. Our CCA organizes a wide range of fun-filled activities for all our budding footballers from the basic technical drills to the more complex tactical plays. Before Covid-19, students in our CCA can look forward to playing around 1-2 friendly matches against other schools every month. Our passionate teachers and coaches are committed to cultivate the love for football, good character, self-discipline in training and preparing our boys for matches and tournaments.
