### Introduction

![mascot](/images/Infocomm%20mascot.png)

The Infocomm Technology CCA provides students the platform to appreciate technology and equip them with Information Technology (IT) skills required in the future. Our CCA is branched into three main areas – Public Address (PA), Photography & Videography and Media (Animation). Lower secondary members will have the opportunity to acquire skills from all three areas and specialise in one of the branches based on their interest and relevant competencies when they progress to Secondary 3. Through opportunities to showcase their talent in national competitions and school events, our CCA members also develop important 21st century competencies which are essential to prepare them for the future.
