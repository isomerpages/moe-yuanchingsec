<p>The Infocomm Technology CCA provides students the platform to appreciate
technology and equip them with Information Technology (IT) skills required
in the future. Our CCA is branched into three main areas – Public Address
(PA), Photography &amp; Videography and Media (Animation). Lower secondary
members will have the opportunity to acquire skills from all three areas
and specialise in one of the branches based on their interest and relevant
competencies when they progress to Secondary 3. Through opportunities to
showcase their talent in national competitions and school events, our CCA
members also develop important 21st century competencies which are essential
to prepare them for the future.</p>
