<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In line with Singapore's vision of becoming a Smart Nation, YCSS Robotics
Club seeks to equip students with important 21st Century Competencies such
as Critical and Inventive Thinking skills as well as Communication, Collaboration
and Information skills.</p>
<p>Learn to assemble robots, design robot creatures and program robotic movements!
We encourage teamwork and creativity while applying problem-solving skills
and technical knowledge in order to learn more about the role of technology
in our world! We also aim to develop in our students the skills to acquire
independence, develop their character and cultivate a strong determination
to strive for excellence.</p>
<p><strong><u>VISION &amp; MISSION </u></strong>
<br>YCSS Robotics Club aims to generate interest among its members for Robotics
in a fun and innovative way. It aims to provide for the students an avenue
to exercise their creativity, resilience and cooperation through the development
of robot models in preparation for competitions. We also aim to promote
self-directed and collaborative learning through the use of problem-based
learning approaches.</p>
