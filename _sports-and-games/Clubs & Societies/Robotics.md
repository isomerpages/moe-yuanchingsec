### Introduction

In line with Singapore's vision of becoming a Smart Nation, YCSS Robotics Club seeks to equip students with important 21st Century Competencies such as Critical and Inventive Thinking skills as well as Communication, Collaboration and Information skills.

Learn to assemble robots, design robot creatures and program robotic movements! We encourage teamwork and creativity while applying problem-solving skills and technical knowledge in order to learn more about the role of technology in our world! We also aim to develop in our students the skills to acquire independence, develop their character and cultivate a strong determination to strive for excellence.

<u><strong> VISION &amp; MISSION </strong></u> <br>
YCSS Robotics Club aims to generate interest among its members for Robotics in a fun and innovative way. It aims to provide for the students an avenue to exercise their creativity, resilience and cooperation through the development of robot models in preparation for competitions. We also aim to promote self-directed and collaborative learning through the use of problem-based learning approaches.

### CCA Activities

Students will be exposed to four steps of visual thinking namely Looking, Seeing, Imagining and Showing in:
*   Construct EV3/ Lego Spike robots
*   Learn the main Programming language (Mindstorm) that controls robot movements and functions
*   Fine-tuning and debug for tasks challenges
*   Preparation for local robotics competitions
*   Learn additional programming languages (Python and Sketch) to augment logical thinking skills and applications.
