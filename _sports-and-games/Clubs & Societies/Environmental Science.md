### Introduction

The Environmental Science Club was formed in January 2012 with the aim of developing student leaders to lead the environmental initiatives in Yuan Ching Secondary School.  

The club takes on a “Head-Heart-Hand” approach in which we aim to influence others to be more environmentally friendly, carry out eco-activities to play our part for the environment and inspire others in going green.

In the Environmental Science Club, we aim to spread environmental awareness within our school and in the community. Our Values-In-Actions (VIA) projects consist of activities that spread environmental messages to the residents in the community.

<u><Strong> VISION </strong></u><br>
To see our students become a well-informed and compassionate citizen of nature with all-rounded skills.  

<u><strong> MISSION </strong></u><br>
To enthuse students in critical and creative engagements in issues and services pertaining to nature and the environment.
