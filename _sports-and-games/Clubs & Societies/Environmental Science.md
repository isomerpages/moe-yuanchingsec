<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Environmental Science CCA was formed in January 2012 with the aim
of developing student leaders to lead the environmental initiatives in
Yuan Ching Secondary School.</p>
<p>The club takes on a “Head-Heart-Hand” approach in which we aim to influence
others to be more environmentally friendly, carry out eco-activities to
play our part for the environment and inspire others in going green.</p>
<p>In the Environmental Science, we aim to spread environmental awareness
within our school and in the community. Our Values-In-Actions (VIA) projects
consist of activities that spread environmental messages to the residents
in the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>VISION </u></strong>
<br>To see our students become a well-informed and compassionate citizen of
nature with all-rounded skills.</p>
<p><strong><u>MISSION </u></strong>
<br>To enthuse students in critical and creative engagements in issues and
services pertaining to nature and the environment.</p>
