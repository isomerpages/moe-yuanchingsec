### Introduction

The Library CCA is where like-minded students come together to read and promote literacy in school. While picking up new skills such as designing, summarizing, and publishing book reviews and posters, students also brainstorm about raising literary interest in their peers as well. The Library CCA also supports various school events such as Ethnic Celebrations and Teachers' Day, through related literary activities or display boards to raise awareness.

Be the welcoming heart of our school where all can come to read, learn, discover and connect.
