### Introduction

The Indian dance is full of vibrant energy and colours. Our dance choreographies are usually based on ancient stories which depict the joy of victories and celebrations. As part of our training, members also learn the different genres of Indian dance, their history and stories behind it.

In Indian Dance, we continuously challenge ourselves and persevere to improve in order to reach greater heights. For instance, students are given opportunities to select their own preference of music and choreograph their dance with some assistance from our instructor. This is to allow the development of creativity and ownership of their performances.

Apart from dancing, our members work closely with Taman Jurong CC and have contributed to the various community projects.
