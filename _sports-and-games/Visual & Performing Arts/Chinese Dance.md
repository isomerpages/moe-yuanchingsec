### Introduction

Our Chinese Dance is a warm family welcoming all the students who love dance. We provide the opportunities and platforms for the dancers to show their talents - truly displaying their unwavering passion for dance. And meanwhile, a strong set of values is instilled in each and every dance as we embark on our journey and this enables us to discover our potential beyond dance. We engage professional dance instructors to coach the dances. Chinese Dance practice sessions begin with a 20-minute warm up, after which, the instructor will train dancers on the specific movements of the choreography. They will then end off with dancing to music accompaniments. Character development is infused into weekly CCA sessions in which the teachers and instructors emphasize the importance of teamwork and resilience. Dancers are also encouraged to strive for their best during the practice sessions.
