<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We are delighted to introduce the vibrant world of Chinese Dance in Yuan
Ching. Our Chinese Dance CCA group is a dynamic and inclusive community
of students who share a passion for the rich and captivating art of Chinese
dance. Under the guidance of our professional dance instructor (fondly
known to our students as Li Lao Shi), our Chinese Dance CCA members embark
on a journey of self-discovery, teamwork, and cultural appreciation in
every practice session. Every session will start with a 20-minute warm-up
segment, followed by focused practice on specific dance techniques, culminating
in the integration of these techniques into a choreographed routine. Whether
you are a seasoned dancer or new to the world of Chinese dance, our CCA
provides a welcoming and supportive environment for you to grow and thrive.
Join us on this exciting adventure as we celebrate the art, culture, and
camaraderie that Chinese Dance has to offer. We look forward to warmly
welcoming you to our Chinese Dance family here at Yuan Ching.</p>
