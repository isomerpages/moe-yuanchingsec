### Introduction

We are delighted to introduce the vibrant world of Chinese Dance in Yuan Ching. Our Chinese Dance CCA group is a dynamic and inclusive community of students who share a passion for the rich and captivating art of Chinese dance. 
Under the guidance of our professional dance instructor (fondly known to our students as Li Lao Shi), our Chinese Dance CCA members embark on a journey of self-discovery, teamwork, and cultural appreciation in every practice session. Every session will start with a 20-minute warm-up segment, followed by focused practice on specific dance techniques, culminating in the integration of these techniques into a choreographed routine.
Whether you are a seasoned dancer or new to the world of Chinese dance, our CCA provides a welcoming and supportive environment for you to grow and thrive. Join us on this exciting adventure as we celebrate the art, culture, and camaraderie that Chinese Dance has to offer. We look forward to warmly welcoming you to our Chinese Dance family here at Yuan Ching.

### Vision
We believe everyone loves dance, enjoys dance, and can dance.


### Mission
To nurture the love for dance as a performing art, and to instil perseverance and responsibility in our dancers through weekly practices.
