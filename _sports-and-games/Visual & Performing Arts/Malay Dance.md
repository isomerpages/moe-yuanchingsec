### Introduction

In Yuan Ching Secondary, our Malay dancers will be introduced to the different dance genres both in dance movement as well as in theoretical aspects behind each dance.

Our Dancers will also have opportunities to explore the use of dance props, accessories and costumes according to each genre.

At the end of each practice session and performance, a debrief session will be conducted to allow dancers to reflect on their dance experiences and challenges. The Teachers-in-charge, instructor and dance members will also be using this platform to affirm dancers who have demonstrated the school values of iExCEL.

### CCA Activities

*   Every dance practice session will begin with a series of warm up routines comprising of physical exercises such as running, stretching and strengthening exercises.
*   Dancers will learn the foundational techniques and cultural context of different dance genres.
