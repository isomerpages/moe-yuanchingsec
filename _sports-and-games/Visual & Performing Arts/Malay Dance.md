<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In Yuan Ching Secondary, our Malay dancers will be introduced to the different
dance genres both in dance movement as well as in theoretical aspects behind
each dance. Our dancers will also have opportunities to explore the use
of dance props, accessories, and costumes according to each genre.</p>
<p>At the end of each practice session and performance, a debrief session
will be conducted to allow dancers to reflect on their dance experiences
and challenges. The Teachers-in-charge, instructor and dance members will
also be using this platform to affirm dancers who have demonstrated the
school values of iExCEL.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>CCA Activities</h3>
<p>Every dance practice session will begin with a series of warm up routines
comprising of physical exercises such as running, stretching, and strengthening
exercises. Dancers will learn the foundational techniques and cultural
context of different dance genres.</p>
