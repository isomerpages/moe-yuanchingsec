Dear Parents and Alumni, our Annual Cross Country will return after a 4-year hiatus!

Join us in this mass sporting event as we have included other activities, too, as part of our 45th Anniversary Celebrations. We will be having a fun walk with quizzes to be completed along the way, a lucky draw, a food carnival, a birthday celebration and a commemorative 45th Anniversary T-shirt for you.

If you would like to participate as a volunteer or join us for the fun walk or competitive run, sign up using the link by 21 April, Friday.

We will get in touch with you soon. While ‚Äúslots‚Äù last! üí™
