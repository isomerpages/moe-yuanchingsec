### Year End Holiday Crime Prevention Advisory 

[End of Year School Holiday Advisory](/files/end%20of%20year%20school%20holiday%20advisory.pdf)

With the year end school holidays approaching, SPF, CNB, NCPC and NCADA have jointly provided an advisory to remind students to stay away from crime and drug/inhalant abuse. The advisory alerts students to dangers of common crimes such as online scams, and encourages them to protect themselves from becoming victims of crime or scams, to stay away from crime and drug/ inhalant abuse, especially vaping. 

We hope parents will help to monitor their child‚Äôs social activity, especially those conducted online and take the opportunity to guide them in using the internet safely and the impact of drug/inhalant abuse and vaping. You may refer to the attached Joint Advisory for more information. 

We thank you for the support and partnership with the school on your child‚Äôs/ward‚Äôs education journey. 

Thank you.
