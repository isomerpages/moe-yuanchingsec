SYFgoesOnline! is a virtual arts festival by students from Singapore schools that showcases the creativity, vibrancy, and resilience of our youths, as our nation stands united in the face of current challenges. Through fun and easy-to-follow mini online projects involving Art, Dance, Music and Drama, SYFGoesOnline! brings together the voices of youths to express our hopes, dreams and desire to uplift and inspire. Family members are also welcome to participate in some of these projects.  
  
Participation in any of the projects is optional. However, the school encourages your child/ward to showcase their talents and continue to develop his/her personal mastery of skill/craft at home. Some students may also be encouraged by their teachers to take part in some of the projects. For more information, please refer to the web links below.

Should your child/ward be interested in participating in any of the projects, he/she may contact Mr Jack Liew at [liew\_wei\_sheng@moe.edu.sg](mailto:liew_wei_sheng@moe.edu.sg).
