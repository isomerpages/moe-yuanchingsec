In the town of Jurong, Stands our Yuan Ching School.  
The students of our school, The Nation's future leaders.  
Efforts today, Rewards tomorrow.  
We love our People and We love our Nation too.  
Be strong, be healthy; Be a man of character.  
Learning and working must have, Beginning and end.  
Strive hard for progress, Act as good pioneers.  
When you have success in life, Forget not Yuan Ching School.
