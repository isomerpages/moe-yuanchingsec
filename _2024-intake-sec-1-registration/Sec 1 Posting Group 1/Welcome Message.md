Dear Parent/Guardian,&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to Yuan Ching! By joining us, you made the right decision to embark you child/ward on a journey towards life-long learning that will eventually lead to success! Congratulations!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We aim to provide your child/ward with a learner-centric and values-driven education that nurtures holistic development. This is encapsulated in our School Mission of 'Enriching Minds, Unleashing Potential, Impacting Lives' and our School Vision of developing every student to be 'A Thinker, an Achiever, and a Concerned Citizen'.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anchoring our mission and vision is our school values which we uphold and enact through the lenses of a positive education and mental resilience. Our Total Curriculum is guided by the principles of being <u>I</u>nclusive,&nbsp;<u>E</u>xperiential,&nbsp;<u>C</u>ontemporary,&nbsp;<u>E</u>-enabled and one that inculcates a&nbsp;<u>L</u>ife-long learning mindset (I ExCEL)

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is our belief that the potential of every child is best realised with the strong support and active partnership of parents/guardians. We strongly encourage parents to join our Parent Support Group (PSG) and the Positive Parenting Programme (PPP) so that we can nurture our learners in the best way possible, together hand-in-hand.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To welcome your child/ward and to induct him/her into the new Yuan Ching family, our teachers and student leaders have been working hard to put together a&nbsp;Sec 1 Orientation Programme from 4 to 6 Jan 2022 (Tues to Thu), followed by a&nbsp;virtual campfire on 7 Jan 2022 (Fri) ending at 5.30pm.&nbsp;Lunch will be provided for the students. There will be a CCA showcase on 4, 6 and 7 Jan 2022 in the afternoon for students to learn about the various CCAs in Yuan Ching.

It will be issued to your child/ward during the Sec 1 Orientation.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We will meet you virtually on&nbsp;8 Jan 2022 (Sat) at 9.00am&nbsp;to share with you more about Yuan Ching during the Principal’s Address. We look forward to a meaningful and fruitful partnership with you in the years ahead.

### Welcome Message from our Student Development Team for Students

Dear Students,

We congratulate you on your successful completion of the Primary School Leaving Examination, as well as your admission to Yuan Ching Secondary School (YCSS)! As you embark on your secondary education, you may look forward to an exciting journey and enjoyable holistic learning experiences in our school. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first week of school will be an exciting one. Our Student Council has planned a week of orientation activities from 2 to 5 Jan 2024 especially for you. You will familiarise yourself with the school environment and get to make new friends. There will also be a CCA showcase on 13 Jan 2024 to help you make an informed decision on your choice of CCA! </p>
 
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you embark on the Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) journey in secondary school, there will be numerous opportunities for you to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds. You will also be empowered with a personalized and tailored learning experience that will allow you to explore and excel in subjects that align with your strengths and interests. In addition, you will have more flexibility to practise self-directedness in planning and managing your learning, especially on Blended Learning days. Through the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), you will also own an iPad and use it for learning! With regards to your academic curriculum, you will take on new subjects such as History, Geography, English Literature, Food &amp; Consumer Education as well as Design &amp; Technology. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Don't worry, when you transit from Primary to Secondary School, we will be there to support you! As our school motto goes, 'Efforts Today, Rewards Tomorrow'. We believe so long as you have a good attitude and positive mindset, you will be able to do it! </p>
