Trips for Internationalisation Experience (TIE) are organized for students to experience an overseas learning journey at least once during his or her time in school.  

Objectives: <br>
(1) Develop in students the 21st Century Competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills that would enable them to develop cultural sensitivities; <br>
(2) Expose students to Asia and the world and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world; <br>
(3) Deepen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

Our internationalization trips provide authentic learning opportunities through pre-trip research, interaction and bonding with people of different cultures as well as process of reflections. The school will continue to provide more authentic learning experiences through internationalization trips for students.

The making of xiao long bao（小笼包）was a fun and memorable experience because we get to make the xiao long bao with the raw ingredients. I realise that making xiao long bao was much tougher than I thought. You would need the skills and experience to ensure the filling was adequate without breaking the skin. Xiao long bao never tasted this good!

Students in Shanghai lead a different routine compared to Singapore students, as they have eye exercises in between their lessons to relieve the eye stress. The Duoyun bookstore is unique as there is a cafe inside the bookstore. You will need to buy drinks to be able to enjoy the view outside.
