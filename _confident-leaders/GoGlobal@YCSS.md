Trips for Internationalisation Experience (TIE) are organized for students to experience an overseas learning journey at least once during his or her time in school.  

Objectives: <br>
(1) Develop in students the 21st Century Competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills that would enable them to develop cultural sensitivities; <br>
(2) Expose students to Asia and the world and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world; <br>
(3) Deepen studentsâ€™ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

Our internationalization trips provide authentic learning opportunities through pre-trip research, interaction and bonding with people of different cultures as well as process of reflections. The school will continue to provide more authentic learning experiences through internationalization trips for students.
