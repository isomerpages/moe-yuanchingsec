### Citizenship Education

**YCSS Head Heart Hands and Values-based National Education Framework**

In addition, it also weaves our school **I ExCEL** values of **Integrity**, **Excellence**, **Compassion**, **Enterprise** and **Loyalty** into our NE programmes which include Learning Journeys and Community Involvement Programme for all levels.

The "Head, Heart and Hands" framework was recommended by the MOE's Committee on NE and guides the next phase of NE. The architectural principles of our NE framework are very simply, the 3Hs- **Head**, **Heart** & **Hands**.  

"Head", "Heart" and "Hands" will be the focus of engagement at all levels, but with varying emphases as appropriate to the age and maturity of the students.

<u><strong> Head </strong></u><br>
In engaging the Head, we teach our students to **Know** the Singapore Story, to **Think** through and to **Understand** the issues facing Singapore.  

<u><strong> Heart </strong></u><br>
When we engage the Heart, we inspire our students to Love our nation, **Appreciate** what we stand for and feel that they **Belong**.  

<u><strong> Hands </strong></u><br>
In engaging the Hands, we equip and motivate our students to **Contribute** to our nation, to Create Singapore's future, and to **Lead** in different fields of society.

The three principles in the **second ring** - **Quality**, **Customisation** and **Ownership**, are guiding principles that underline all of the Committee's recommendation. As our students progress through the secondary levels, they should gradually move from understanding basic facts about our nation's past, to understanding how Singapore is evolving in the present. The **outer-most ring** represents three key groups of stakeholders that are involved in the delivery of NE - **educators**, **students** and the **community**. This reinforces the idea that NE is owned by everyone, and emphasizes the importance of community partners in the process of NE.

The core **R3ICH** values in the MOE CME syllabus are namely, **Respect**, **Responsibility**, **Resilience**, **Integrity**, **Care** and **Harmony**, which form the foundation upon which good character is built. These values complement and reinforce National Education messages. They will guide students to discern between right and wrong, and will help them to not only make responsible choices, but also become more aware of their role in society.
