### OVERVIEW

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of the holistic education at Yuan Ching Secondary School. We believe that every school experience has the potential to be transformed into a CCE lesson when students are guided to learn, apply and demonstrate values, character, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions. Thus, CCE extends beyond the CCE classroom to authentic student development experiences.

### THE CCE 2021 CURRICULUM FRAME

CCE Curriculum Content is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It comprises the learning of core values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.

<figcaption> Through the integrated Racial Harmony Day and Welcome In My Back Yard activities, students understood that the Migrant Workers MWs were part of our social fabric and have contributed to Singapore’s rapid development till date. Our students were grateful for the opportunities to pen notes of encouragement to the MWs, as they settled into the Taman Jurong Community. These notes of encouragement also serve as morale booster for the MWs and they were subsequently presented to the MWs through WIMBY. </figcaption>
