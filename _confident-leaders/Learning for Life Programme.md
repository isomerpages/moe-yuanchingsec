To provide a greater breadth of experiences and learning opportunities, the scope of our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) has been broadened to that of ‘Sports and Outdoor Education’ with elements of Dragon Boat in 2018. Hence the name and theme of the LLP is ‘gRowing Values through Sports and Outdoor Experiences’. In 2020, we enhanced our LLP with an addition of our signature Talent Development Programme to leverage character and life skills development for all students.

In the development of students’ Talents and Aspirations, the school adopted a two-tiered approach in LLP to engage both the general student population and student segments with aptitude and interests for talent development (Refer to Figure 1).

The outer ring of our LLP framework is a safety float, symbolising the notion of safety and risk assessment. On the ring, the desired student outcomes are encapsulated in the acronym ‘GRIT21’ (G – Growth Mindset, R – Resilience, I – IExCEL (School Values), T – Thrive, 21 – 21st Century Competencies). To achieve these student outcomes, students undergo the Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle through the following processes - Experimentation, Experience, Reflection and Conceptualisation (Refer to Figure 1).

All students will have the opportunity to demonstrate and develop GRIT21 through Customised Swimming Programme at Secondary 1, Dragon Boat Orientation at Secondary 2 and Dragon Boat Quest at Secondary 3. To enhance cohort level for deeper experiences, the school provides integrated outdoor and experiential programmes that engage the students’ sense of adventure through the exploration of both natural and urban environments. Students also develop appropriate outdoor skills through physical activities while cultivating an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful consideration of the risks and safety of self and others. These authentic experiences are supplemented with other enrichment programmes such as the Customised Sports Education Programme, Sports Modules and CCE learning packages.

To deepen students’ 21st Century Competencies, those with good aptitude and interest in Sports and Games will have the option to participate in the Tier-2 Talent Development Programme. They will then have the opportunity to engage in dialogues with practitioners from the sports industry, go for LLP related learning journeys and experience a multi-sport exposure.

Despite all the adversities COVID-19 situation has presented to us, the learning of our students is not hampered as different possibilities presented itself in alternative ways. For instance, our students had the opportunity to engage in virtual dialogue and physical activity sessions with athletes of various sports, sports scientist, practitioners, active volunteers in the sporting scene and even students from our partnering schools.

With the removal of Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in 2022, the school would be focusing more on outdoor authentic experiences and exposure to support our students’ development. For instance, the school will be expanding our ‘gRowing’ activities to include Stand Up Paddling for selected students in 2023. Through a variety of different athletic sporting pursuits, we hope to leverage character and life skills development for more students.
