<p>To provide a greater breadth of experiences and learning opportunities,
the scope of our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) has been broadened to
that of ‘Sports and Outdoor Education’ with elements of Dragon Boat in
2018. Hence the name and theme of the LLP is ‘gRowing Values through Sports
and Outdoor Experiences’. In 2020, we enhanced our LLP with an addition
of our signature Talent Development Programme to leverage character and
life skills development for all students.</p>
<p>In the development of students’ Talents and Aspirations, the school adopted
a two-tiered approach in LLP to engage both the general student population
and student segments with aptitude and interests for talent development
(Refer to Figure 1).</p>

<p><strong> Figure 1: LLP Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>The outer ring of our LLP framework is a safety float, symbolising the
notion of safety and risk assessment. On the ring, the desired student
outcomes are encapsulated in the acronym ‘GRIT21’ (G – Growth Mindset,
R – Resilience, I – IExCEL (School Values), T – Thrive, 21 – 21st Century
Competencies). To achieve these student outcomes, students undergo the
Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle through the following processes - Experimentation,
Experience, Reflection and Conceptualisation (Refer to Figure 1).</p>
<p>All students will have the opportunity to demonstrate and develop GRIT21
through Customised Swimming Programme at Secondary 1, Kayaking Orientation
at Secondary 2 and Dragon Boat Quest at Secondary 3. To enhance cohort
level for deeper experiences, the school provides integrated outdoor and
experiential programmes that engage the students’ sense of adventure through
the exploration of both natural and urban environments. Students also develop
appropriate outdoor skills through physical activities while cultivating
an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful
consideration of the risks and safety of self and others. These authentic
experiences are supplemented with other enrichment programmes such as the
Customised Sports Education Programme, Sports Modules and CCE learning
packages.</p>
<p>To deepen students’ 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies, those with good aptitude
and interest in Sports and Games will have the option to participate in
the Tier-2 Talent Development Programme. They will then have the opportunity
to engage in dialogues with practitioners from the sports industry, go
for LLP related learning journeys and experience a multi-sport exposure.</p>
<p>Despite all the adversities COVID-19 situation has presented to us, the
learning of our students is not hampered as different possibilities presented
itself in alternative ways. For instance, our students had the opportunity
to engage in virtual dialogue and physical activity sessions with athletes
of various sports, sports scientist, practitioners, active volunteers in
the sporting scene and even students from our partnering schools.</p>
<p>With the removal of Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in 2022, the school
would be focusing more on outdoor authentic experiences and exposure to
support our students’ development. For instance, the school will be expanding
our ‘gRowing’ activities to include Stand Up Paddling for selected students
in 2023. Through a variety of different athletic sporting pursuits, we
hope to leverage character and life skills development for more students.</p>
