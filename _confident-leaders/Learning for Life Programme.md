<p>We believe that leadership begins with the courage to serve, the ability
to influence others for the better, and the strength of character to do
what is right, even when no one is watching.</p>
<p>Our Community Youth Leadership (CYL) Learning for Life Programme nurtures
students to become self-aware individuals, compassionate changemakers,
and visionary leaders who make a meaningful difference within and beyond
their communities.</p>
<p>Rooted in our school values of Integrity, Excellence, Compassion, Enterprise,
and Loyalty (IExCEL), the CYL programme is designed to progressively develop
students’ leadership capacity through authentic, purposeful experiences.
It fosters empathy, cultivates resilience, and builds a strong sense of
social responsibility in every student.</p>

<p>The CYL programme follows a three-tiered developmental framework:</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1 (Rise): Basic Leadership for All Students</strong>
<br>All Secondary 1 to 3 students develop foundational leadership skills grounded
in Servant Leadership principles. They participate in Values-in-Action
(VIA) projects through their CCAs, undergo Design Thinking training, and
work towards the Silver National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA). Students
cultivate empathy, personal responsibility, and a commitment to community
care.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2 (Lead): Intermediate Leadership for Identified Student Leaders</strong>
<br>Formal student leaders — such as Student Councillors, Class Chairpersons,
Peer Support Leaders, CCE Leaders, and top-tier CCA Leaders — are guided
through The Leadership Challenge model by Kouzes and Posner. They undergo
role-specific leadership training, plan school-wide initiatives, and collaborate
with grassroots organisations to deepen community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3 (Elevate): Strategic Leadership for Selected Student Leaders</strong>
<br>Exceptional leaders who have excelled in Tier 2 are selected to lead student-initiated
VIA projects, participate in national leadership platforms, and mentor
younger leaders. They craft a personal leadership legacy rooted in vision,
empathy, and service, and may represent the school in national or overseas
service-learning initiatives.</p>
