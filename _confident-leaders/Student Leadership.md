### OVERVIEW OF STUDENT LEADERSHIP

Student leadership development is an integral part of the overall student development programme in Yuan Ching. Aligned to the school vision of every student ‘A Thinker, an Achiever and a Concerned Citizen’, the student leadership development is anchored on the belief of ’Every Student a Leader’.  

A tiered approach is adopted for student leadership development. All students undergo basic personal leadership development, with opportunities provided to develop themselves progressively through customized programmes.

The progressive development of our student leaders is achieved through differentiated training and assessment for each of the 3 levels of student leadership: Personal Leadership, Peer Leadership and Inspiring Leadership for the respective segments of student leaders.
