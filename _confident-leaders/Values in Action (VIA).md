The school’s policy for its responsibility to society is underpinned by our values of Excellence, Compassion and Loyalty and guided by our vision; Every Individual: A Thinker, An Achiever and a Concerned Citizen. The school’s goal for VIA is to engage students in meaningful activities and programmes that will support and meet societal and community needs and aspirations. Students are provided with a range of experiences and exposure to the needs of society and community through the school’s Values in Action (VIA) Programme and student-initiated VIA programmes in their CCAs.  

As an integral part of our school vision, the school’s VIA Programme seeks to develop students into concerned citizens who demonstrate respect, responsibility, sense of rootedness and a strong desire to serve the community. The objectives of the VIA programme are:
*   To nurture our students to become respectful and socially responsible members of the school and community; and
*   To develop in our students a deep sense of rootedness to Singapore and desire to serve through active participation and service to the community.

<u><strong> Implementation Approach </strong></u> <br>
A developmental approach that spirals upwards in terms of outreach, impact and complexity, is adopted for the planning and implementation of VIA programmes for the respective levels. Implementation is driven by strong school-community links and a 5-stage Service Learning approach: **I**nvestigation, **D**esign, **A**ction,  **R**eflection and **E**xhibition (**I DARE**). From 2021, the school will be leveraging on Design Thinking to help anchor the methodology in which we implement VIA programmes at the school-wide level.
