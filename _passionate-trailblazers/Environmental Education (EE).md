<p><strong><u>Vision: </u></strong>
<br>Every Yuan Ching student an advocate for a sustainable future</p>
<p>Through the schoolâ€™s Environmental Education (EE) programmes, our students
will be more aware of the need for sustainable practices in everyday life.
Grounded in values, they will go on to role model desirable actions related
to sustainability and be advocates of the sustainable practices to others.</p>
<p>Our students experience EE through their daily lessons, Co-Curricular
Activities (CCAs) and other school-wide programmes. Using the Head-Heart-Hands
approach, the students will undergo experiential learning to better appreciate
and internalise how our actions play a part towards a sustainable future.</p>
<p>We develop student leadership in sustainability through our Environment
Champions (E-Champs) programme, by providing training opportunities for
our E-Champs to advocate for sustainability in their classes and beyond.
Our vibrant Environment Club (E-Club) partners with our community to spread
the sustainability message through outreach talks and exhibitions.</p>
