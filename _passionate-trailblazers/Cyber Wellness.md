<p>The MOE Cyber Wellness Framework guides the school in planning for our
cyber wellness programme.</p>
<p>The Framework focuses on developing the child’s instinct to protect himself
and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.
Thus, this framework highlights three principles to guide students in their
actions, describes a 3-step process to explore cyber wellness issues and
encourages schools to partner parents in promoting cyber wellness among
students.</p>
