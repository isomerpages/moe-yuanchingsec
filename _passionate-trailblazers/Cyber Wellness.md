The MOE Cyber Wellness Framework guides the school in planning for our cyber wellness programme.

The Framework focuses on developing the child’s instinct to protect himself and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. Thus, this framework highlights three principles to guide students in their actions, describes a 3-step process to explore cyber wellness issues and encourages schools to partner parents in promoting cyber wellness among students.
