<p>As Yuan Ching journey towards organisational excellence and becoming a
learning organisation, Design Thinking is identified as one of the key
methodology since 2020, to engender a culture of innovation which is critical
to enhancing creativity and expanding the boundaries of possibilities.</p>
<p>Design Thinking is a human-centred approach with an iterative process
to tackle problems. It relies on observation, with emphasis on empathy
to truly understand the needs of the user, and creating a prototype that
caters to solving the problem defined. There is also a strong emphasis
on the iteration process of prototyping and testing, observing the user
experience and at times, even re-defining the problem in order to solve
the issue at hand. This embodies the spirit of innovation and the tenacity
required to strive towards excellence, aligned to our school values of
Excellence and Enterprise, and the school’s vision of developing students
to be a Thinker, an Achiever and a Concerned Citizen.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Designing Values-in-Action programmes mentored by Form Teachers</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Secondary 2 </u>
<br>Students take on a more rigorous challenge in the designing and making
of water robot capable of completing assigned tasks and deepen their learning

<p>Equipped with a good working knowledge of Design Thinking, the staff plays
a key role in shaping students’ mindset while mentoring them in their journey
towards embracing the spirit of design thinking in their endeavours.</p>
<p>As an organisation, Design Thinking is also embedded in the implementation
of the YCSS Idea Bank, where staff put forth suggestions to solve current
challenges or improve processes. Staff are affirmed of their contributions
regularly during Staff Conference, with their innovative inputs spotlighted
