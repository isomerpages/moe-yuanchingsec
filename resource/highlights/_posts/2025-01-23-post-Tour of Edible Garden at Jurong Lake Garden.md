<p>Experiential Learning in Action: Yuan Ching Secondary School Students
Lead Tours at Jurong Lake Ediable Garden</p>
<p>After two comprehensive training sessions, Yuan Ching Secondary School's
Sec 4 Higher Chinese students successfully conducted public tours at Jurong
Lake Edible Garden. The students meticulously prepared by consolidating
information, planning routes, and assigning roles to ensure an optimal
visitor experience.</p>
<p>This hands-on activity provided students with valuable real-world communication
practice. They not only shared their knowledge but also gained new insights
through interactions with the public. The positive feedback from visitors
greatly encouraged our young guides.This experiential learning opportunity
allowed our students to apply their language skills in a practical setting
while contributing to community engagement and environmental education.</p>
