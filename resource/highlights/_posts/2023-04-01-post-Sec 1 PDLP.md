Our students are indeed very excited to explore fun lessons with their iPads!

Sec 1 students have collected and unboxed their devices on 22 March during curriculum time. 
You can refer to [https://go.gov.sg/pdlpparenthandbook](https://go.gov.sg/pdlpparenthandbook) for more information on learning with a
personal leaning device and tips and resources on supporting your child/ward in his/her digital
learning journey.
