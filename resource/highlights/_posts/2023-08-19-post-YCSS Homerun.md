This morning, we led a group of 107 students and teachers to participate in the [Homerun](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwH7wfgBk_P/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) event organized by&nbsp;[@homerun.tj](https://www.instagram.com/homerun.tj/)&nbsp;in the Taman Jurong Constituency. 30 sports leaders served as road marshals, assisting at the booths and shadowing committee members, while 77 students and staff from our school each completed a 7km run. This was part of their effort to contribute to sponsorship for those in need within the area.  
  
We are pleased to have contributed to this community event, promoting both our physical well-being and community engagement. This initiative aligns with our Learning for Life framework of GRIT21, coupled with the development of 21st-century competencies!
