# Blended Learning Days 2023 <br>
Students will be faced with an evolving workplace culture where there will be a mix of in-person working as well as remote working from home. In our efforts to prepare our students for a dynamic future, Yuan Ching Secondary School will be scheduling Blended Learning Days on **even week Fridays** in **Semester One** for **all levels** and on **3 days in July for Secondary 1 to 3**.

On Blended Learning days, students would engage in Home-Based Learning that complements their in-person schooling curriculum and carry out Student-Initiated Learning activities.

1. **Home-Based Learning <br>**
Home-Based Learning (HBL) learning will take the form of ICT-based learning, independent research-work, collaborative learning and learning from different authentic sources. The blending of different modes of learning will enable students to benefit from a range of learning experiences
and aims to encourage our students to be more self-directed and independent in their learning. For HBL Days, students will obtain the information on their learning tasks/ activities/ assignments on the school’s ICT website, https://sites.google.com/view/hblyuanching/blended-learning-dayhbl.
Students can decide to work on the tasks without the need to follow a fixed time-table structure and are given the autonomy and space to organise their learning.
Students who need to return to school on HBL Days can do so in consultation with their teachers. These include students who require closer supervision and a more conducive environment for learning. These students will conduct their learning according to the school's planned schedule, similar to those who are at home.
2. **Student-Initiated Learning <br>**
In Yuan Ching Secondary School, Student-Initiated Learning will be known as Developing Interests Via Exploration (DIVE) and will involve the Secondary 1-3 students. They will be able to exercise agency, explore their interests, passions, and learn within and beyond the curriculum as learning should not be confined to the formal curriculum. For students who face challenges in their DIVE journey, resources are available on the school’s ICT website,
https://sites.google.com/view/hblyuanching/dive-student-initiated-learning.
Students should complete their DIVE activities at home or in school. They must consult their teachers to ascertain that the planned learning activity is appropriate, safe, and meaningful. They must also seek prior permission from their parents. Each DIVE session should be planned for an
estimated duration of about one hour.
