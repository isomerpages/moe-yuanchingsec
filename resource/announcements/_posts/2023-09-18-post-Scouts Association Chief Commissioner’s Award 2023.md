Our heartiest congratulations to Kai Ren (S4-I) and Nikole Wong (S4-C) for attaining the pinnacle of achievement in being recipients of the Chief Commissioner’s Award 2023! This award is testament of their efforts in honing their Scouting skills and craft since Sec 1!

The Chief Commissioner’s Award is conferred to the Singapore Scouts Association’s most outstanding and distinctive Scouts in recognition of their leadership skills, exemplary performance, dedication as well as services. 

Special thanks to the Scouts CCA Teachers - Say Kin who is also Scouts Association National Programme Coordinator, Nadia and Yi Hui - for their leadership and dedication in guiding them to be leaders they are today. 

May their achievements inspire our Yuan Ching students to strive for excellence and dedication in service of the community, epitomising the vision of ‘A Thinker, An Achiever and a Concerned Citizen’.
