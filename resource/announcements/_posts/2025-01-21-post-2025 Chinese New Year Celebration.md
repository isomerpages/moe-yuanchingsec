<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p></p>
<p>The school will be organizing a Chinese New Year (CNY) Celebrations on
28 Jan 2025 (Tue) from 0730am to 1030am. As part of the celebrations, students
will be engaged in a range of interactive and meaningful hands-on activities
as they learn more about cultural aspects of Chinese traditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students will be dismissed at about 10.30am after the school celebrations.
The school will close at 12pm on 28 Jan 2025 and during the CNY Public
Holidays on 29 and 30 Jan 2025. As 31 Jan 2025 (Fri) is a Blended Learning
Day, students need not report to school that day. Students will only report
to school on 3 Feb 2025 (Mon).</p>
<p></p>
<p>More details will be given to the students closer to the event. We wish
all parents and students a Happy and Prosperous Lunar New Year in advance.</p>
