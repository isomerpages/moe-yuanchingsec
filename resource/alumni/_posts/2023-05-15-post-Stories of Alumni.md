<p style="text-align: justify;">Our alumna (Class of 2015), Nur Hidayah Mohd Tahir, is one of the nine recipients of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) Awards 2023. She achieved the Promising Youth Award, a newly introduced category, during the ceremony that took place at the Istana on Saturday, August 12, 2023. The Muis Awards hold the purpose of acknowledging the significant contributions made by exceptional individuals in Singapore's socio-religious sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hidayah's dedication to community service has been apparent from a young age, demonstrated by her active involvement in Values-In-Action (VIA) programmes during her time as a student at Yuan Ching. Notably, her eloquence, dynamic character, and leadership aptitude were recognized, leading to her election as the Student Council President. Her proactive approach involved the Student Council in comprehending the needs of Casa Raudha residents, subsequently coordinating volunteer initiatives at the shelter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hidayah's open and inclusive approach cultivates an environment where she readily shares insights and engages empathetically with individuals from diverse backgrounds. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Nur Hidayah for her well-deserved award, and we hope that she continues to inspire others, embodying Yuan Ching's vision of 'A Thinker, An Achiever, and a Concerned Citizen'.</p>
