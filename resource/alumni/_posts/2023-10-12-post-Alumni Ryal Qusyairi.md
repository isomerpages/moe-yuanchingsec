She achieved the Promising Youth Award, a newly introduced category, during the ceremony that took place at the Istana on Saturday, August 12, 2023. The Muis Awards recognise the purpose of acknowledging the significant contributions made by exceptional individuals in Singapore's socio-religious sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hidayah's dedication to community service has been apparent from a young age, demonstrated by her active involvement in Values-In-Action (VIA) programmes during her time as a student at Yuan Ching.
