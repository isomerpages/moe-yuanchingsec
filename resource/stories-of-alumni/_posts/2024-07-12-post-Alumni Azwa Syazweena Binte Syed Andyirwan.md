<p>Our alumna (Class of 2021), Azwa Syazweena, exhibited grit and determination
to achieve the goals she set for herself during her educational journey
at Yuan Ching Secondary. An active learner, she proactively sought support
and solutions to overcome challenges while remaining helpful to friends
in need.</p>
<p>Azwa also distinguished herself as an exceptional member of the Netball
CCA. She was actively involved in Play Inclusive with Grace Orchard School,
a student-initiated Values in Action project that fosters friendships between
students with and without disabilities through sports.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Azwa, on your achievements! We are proud of you and wish
you continued success in your chosen path at Republic Polytechnic's School
of Hospitality. Your dedication and perseverance inspire us all, embodying
Yuan Ching's vision of 'A Thinker, An Achiever, and a Concerned Citizen.'</p>
