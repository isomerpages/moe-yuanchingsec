<p>Riduwan, an alumnus of Yuan Ching Secondary School (Class of 2017), distinguished
    himself as an exceptional executive committee member of the National Police
    Cadet Corps (NPCC). Throughout his educational journey at Yuan Ching, Riduwan
    exemplified the school’s motto “Efforts Today, Rewards Tomorrow” through
    his steadfast resilience and determination in the pursuit of excellence
    in his personal goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Riduwan graduated with academic excellence from the 3-year NITEC course
    in Financial Services. In 2023, he graduated from Republic Polytechnic
    with a Diploma in Integrated Events Management (Merit), having been admitted
    into the programme through the Polytechnic Early Admissions Exercise (EAE).
    He has joined the Singapore Police Force where his experience as a Staff
    Sergeant in NPCC imbued in him a sense of discipline, justice, and a desire
    to serve the community at large. Presently, he has plans to further his
    skills by pursuing a Degree in Criminology, which he feels will serve him
    well in his job as a police officer.</p>
<p></p>

    immense pride in your achievements. May you continue to excel in your chosen
    path and career. Your steadfast resilience and determination to excel inspire
