<h3>Welcome Message from our Student Development Team for Students</h3>
<p>Dear Students,&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very warm welcome to the Yuan Ching Family! We congratulate you on your
successful completion of the Primary School Leaving Examination, as well
as your admission to Yuan Ching Secondary School (YCSS)! As you embark
on your secondary education, you may look forward to an exciting journey
and enjoyable holistic learning experiences in our school.</p>
<p>The first week of school will be an exciting one. Our Student Council
has planned a 4-day orientation programme on&nbsp;2, 3, 6 and 7 Jan 2025&nbsp;&nbsp;especially
for you. You will familiarise yourself with the school environment and
get to make new friends. There will also be a CCA showcase on&nbsp;11 Jan
2025&nbsp;to help you make an informed decision on your choice of CCA!</p>
<p>As you embark on the Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) journey in secondary
school, there will be numerous opportunities for you to interact with peers
from diverse backgrounds. You will also be empowered with a personalized
and tailored learning experience that will allow you to explore and excel
in subjects that align with your strengths and interests. In addition,
you will have more flexibility to practise self-directedness in planning
and managing your learning, especially on Blended Learning days. Through
the Personalised Digital Learning&nbsp;Programme&nbsp;(PDLP), you will
also own an iPad and use it for learning! With regards to your academic
curriculum, you will take on new subjects such as History, Geography, English
Literature, Food &amp; Consumer Education as well as Design &amp; Technology.</p>
<p>Don't worry, when you transit from Primary to Secondary School, we will
be there to support you! As our school motto goes, 'Efforts Today, Rewards
Tomorrow'. We believe so long as you have a good attitude and positive
mindset, you will be able to do it!</p>
<p>We are thrilled that you are joining us and cannot wait to start this
exciting new journey together with you! See you on 2 Jan 2025!</p>
