<p><em>“This is your playground, future engineers. Risk, Experiment, Analyse, Pursue."</em>
</p>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to ignite curiosity, build confidence,
and nurture real-world problem solvers through the theme of&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Engineering Innovations and Solutions.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>We believe every student should be empowered to explore the world of science,
technology, and engineering — not just in theory, but through hands-on,
authentic learning experiences that spark innovation and imagination.</p>
<p>With a focus on real-world applications and deep engineering knowledge,
the ALP empowers students to explore, invent, and excel, building confidence
and skills for the future.</p>

<p>Our Tier 1 ALP is designed for every Yuan Ching student, encouraging exploration
and skill-building through hands-on projects and collaborative learning.</p>
<p><u>Coding and Computational Thinking<br></u>Students set out to learn
computational thinking through coding. The ALP curriculum is centered around
the theme of transportation—land, water, and air—enabling students to explore
the ways coding is used in modern industries. They also learn about AI
technology by coding an AI camera, appreciating how AI transforms sectors
like transportation. Through hands-on experiences with drone technology,
3D modeling, and 3D printing, students gain a practical understanding of
how technology shapes the world.</p>

<p><u>Land Robotics<br></u>Get ready to build and drive your own land crawler!
In Secondary 1, students roll into Land Robotics, constructing fully operational
remote-controlled vehicles from scratch. Through a hands-on, engineering-focused
approach, students will explore the mechanics of vehicle design, master
steering systems, and delve into the world of radio communication. Working
collaboratively, they'll tackle real-world engineering challenges, brainstorm
innovative solutions, and refine their creations. This experience empowers
students to see how engineering principles translate into tangible, moving
results.</p>
<p><u>Marine Robotics<br></u>Dive into the challenge of building an underwater
robot! In Marine Robotics, students create “Seaperches” through a design-thinking
journey that pushes them to risk, experiment, analyse, and pursue their
engineering goals. Teams tackle complex challenges, learning to risk innovative
approaches, experiment with diverse solutions, analyse their outcomes,
and persistently pursue optimal designs. This collaborative experience
fosters teamwork and communication, culminating in a proud showcase of
their robotic creations.</p>
<p><u>Drones and Aerial Robotics</u>
</p>

<p></p>
<p>Take your engineering skills to new heights! In Aerial Robotics, students
explore the fascinating world of drones, uncovering the science and engineering
principles behind their flight. This program provides a comprehensive understanding
of drone operation, from safe handling and assembly to mastering flight
controls.</p>
<p><u>Interdisciplinary Geography-Science Exploration with “Senseperches”<br></u>In
this interdisciplinary project, students transform their Seaperches into
“Senseperches” by mounting them with sensors to monitor water quality at
Jurong Lake Gardens. They use the data collected as part of their geographical
investigation fieldwork, conducting an authentic study on environmental
health. This outdoor learning experience brings classroom theories to life,
helping students gain a deeper appreciation of environmental stewardship.</p>

<p></p>
<p><u>Environmental Science and Data Analysis<br></u>Launched in 2024, our
newest interdisciplinary program combines environmental science with data
analysis. Students use temperature and humidity sensors to monitor their
microgreens growth project, reinforcing the scientific methods of data
collection, analysis, and hypothesis-making taught in science lessons.
Through this hands-on approach, students become budding scientists, learning
that science is not only about answers—it’s about asking the right questions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Tier 2: Talent Development Programme – Fueling the Passionate and Driven</u></strong>
</p>
<p>For students with a deeper interest in STEM, Tier 2 offers a tailored
Talent Development Programme where they Explore, Pursue, and Excel in their
passion areas, gaining experience that goes beyond the basics.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Explore<br></strong>Through modules in 3D drawing and modeling,
along with thrilling learning journeys like the IMDEX International Marine
Trade Show and the Singapore Airshow, students gain valuable exposure to
the high-tech world of marine, aviation, and technology industries.</p>
