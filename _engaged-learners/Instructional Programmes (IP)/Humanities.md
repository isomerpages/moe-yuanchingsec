<p><strong>Department Overview</strong>
<br>Our YCSS Humanities Vision - we aim to develop students to be critical
thinkers; empathetic learners; and be responsible and concerned citizens.</p>
<p>We believe that students’ understanding of the society and the world they
live in through an exploration of diverse issues in a changing environment
with an emphasis on 21st century competencies that promote self-directed
learning is crucial. We also believe in empowering our teachers to deliver
a learner-focused curriculum which is engaging to ignite the passion towards
learning of the Humanities.</p>
<p>Through the use of a variety of pedagogies and assessments, we seek to
promote critical thinking in our students as they are exposed to the disciplines
of Geography History, Social Studies and Principle of Accounts. To further
enrich students’ learning experiences and to imbue the students with a
global outlook, they are also offered opportunities to develop their interests
beyond the classroom to hone in their skills to be effective communicators
and solution seekers.</p>

our students get to participate in various competitions organised by National

<p><strong>Subject-based Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Historical Investigation:</strong>
<br>Historical Investigation is a key component of History education in lower
secondary. It complements the content and gives students the opportunity
to appreciate real-world applications of historical knowledge and skills.
These include (i) collaboration, (ii) communication, (iii) creative and
critical thinking skills which are applicable in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Students work in groups to investigate a historical issue in Singapore’s
history. They gather, analyse and consolidate the available evidence, and
communicate their findings. For example, the Secondary 1 students investigated
the qualities of our early pioneers who had to overcome difficulties and
achieve success in life. They were given opportunities to look at various
written and pictorial sources and present their findings in a platform
using any ICT applications. The Secondary 2 students investigated on the
impact of Japanese Occupation on the lives of the locals. They focused
on the political, economic, social, and cultural aspects of life. The students
did some perspective taking as a local who lived during the Japanese Occupation
and write a diary based on their experiences.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Geographical Investigation:</strong>
<br>Geographical Investigation (GI) provides students with the opportunity
to apply their geographical knowledge and skills in the real world context
by designing and executing their own fieldwork. The analysis of authentic
data with the use of technology allows our students to develop data and
digital literacy. GI is conducted for all levels. In Secondary One, our
students engage in an inter-disciplinary fieldwork where they visit Jurong
Lake Gardens to study the quality of water and appreciate the value of
Jurong Lake Gardens to the surrounding community. Our Secondary Four students,
visit Gardens by the Bay, to understand the success of the site as a tourism
destination by conducting first-hand interviews with tourists. GI provides
the opportunity for our students to engage in collaborative learning with
their friends and step out of the classroom to appreciate the beauty of
Geography in the places and spaces that surrounds us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Issue Investigation (Social Studies):</strong>
<br>Issue Investigation encourages students to identify a societal issue and
to develop a response. The societal issue is one that is of concern to
society and people have points of view about. Through the investigation,
students will also understand the impact the selected societal issue has
on society and develop possible responses and recommendations to address
the issue.</p>
<p>Our Secondary Three students will embark on the Issue Investigation project
in which they will collaborate with their peers to investigate a societal
issue in Singapore and provide feedback to the government regarding issues
they are concerned about. The investigation is designed to deepen their
understanding of societal issues in Singapore through examining the issues
critically by examining various perspectives. This is a great opportunity
for students to practise and strengthen their writing skills and learn
to respond constructively to societal issues as informed, concerned and
participative citizens.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Principles of Accounts (POA)</strong>
<br>Principles of Accounts provide students with knowledge on business accounting
principles and processes and is grounded in communicating and appreciating
the need for ethical conduct in real-world situations. Students have participated
in competitions such as the Build Your Own Business (BYOB) Digital Challenge
and Financial Literacy for Youth (FLY) Challenge organised by the Republic
Polytechnic and have done well in garnering accolades that include the
proposal to manage Hawker Business.</p>
