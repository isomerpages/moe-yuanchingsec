### Key Programmes

![](/images/Humanities.png)

**Department Overview** <br>
Our YCSS Humanities Vision - we aim to develop students to be critical thinkers; empathetic learners; and be responsible and concerned citizens.  

We believe that students’ understanding of the society and the world they live in through an exploration of diverse issues in a changing environment with an emphasis on 21st century competencies that promote self-directed learning is crucial. We also believe in empowering our teachers to deliver a learner-focused curriculum which is engaging to ignite the passion towards learning of the Humanities.  

Through the use of a variety of pedagogies and assessments, we seek to promote critical thinking in our students as they are exposed to the disciplines of Geography History, Social Studies and Principle of Accounts. To further enrich students’ learning experiences and to imbue the students with a global outlook, they are also offered opportunities to develop their interests beyond the classroom to hone in their skills to be effective communicators and solution seekers.

**Enrichment Programmes** <br>
**Talent Development Unit.** The department provides opportunities for students who have a passion for the Humanities to participate in various platforms where they can share their ideas and learn from participants who come from other schools. The department also identifies students and exposes them to various social and global issues and hone their analytical skills. Moreover, our students get to participate in various competitions organised by National University of Singapore, Curriculum Planning & Development Division (Ministry of Education), and other schools.

Some of the platforms where our students have excelled include:
1.  NUS Geography Challenge;
2.  Model United Nations Conferences (MUN) in 2021
*   **Bilingual Youth Model United Nations (BYMUN) Conference** organised by Nanyang Girls’ High School; 2021
*   **OPSG Model United Nations (OPMUN)** **;2021**
*   **Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus Summit (DHAP); 2022**
*   **Singapore Model United Nations (SMUN); 2022**
*   **National Junior College’S 4th International Humanities Symposium (E-IHS) 2021**

3.  History Challenge organised by History Unit (History Unit, MOE).

Our student participants have done well to be awarded prizes for best position paper and best delegate in the mock conferences. Students who excelled were also selected by the Geography Unit, MOE to be part of the Geography Talent Development Programme. One student was selected to be part of the highly competitive National Debate Training Programme 2021.

**Subject-based Programmes** <br>

**Historical Investigation:** <Br>
Historical Investigation is a key component of History education in lower secondary. It complements the content and gives students the opportunity to appreciate real-world applications of historical knowledge and skills. These include (i) collaboration, (ii) communication, (iii) creative and critical thinking skills which are applicable in the 21st century.

Students work in groups to investigate a historical issue in Singapore’s history. They gather, analyse and consolidate the available evidence, and communicate their findings. For example, the Secondary 1 students investigated the qualities of our early pioneers who had to overcome difficulties and achieve success in life. They were given opportunities to look at various written and pictorial sources and present their findings in a platform using any ICT applications. The Secondary 2 students investigated on the impact of Japanese Occupation on the lives of the locals. They focused on the political, economic, social, and cultural aspects of life. The students did some perspective taking as a local who lived during the Japanese Occupation and write a diary based on their experiences.

**Geographical Investigation:** <br>
Geographical Investigation (GI) provides students with the opportunity to apply their geographical knowledge and skills in the real world context by designing and executing their own fieldwork. The analysis of authentic data with the use of technology allows our students to develop data and digital literacy. GI is conducted for all levels. In Secondary One, our students engage in an inter-disciplinary fieldwork where they visit Jurong Lake Gardens to study the quality of water and appreciate the value of Jurong Lake Gardens to the surrounding community. Our Secondary Four students, visit Gardens by the Bay, to understand the success of the site as a tourism destination by conducting first-hand interviews with tourists. GI provides the opportunity for our students to engage in collaborative learning with their friends and step out of the classroom to appreciate the beauty of Geography in the places and spaces that surrounds us.

**Issue Investigation (Social Studies):** <br>
Issue Investigation encourages students to identify a societal issue and to develop a response. The societal issue is one that is of concern to society and people have points of view about. Through the investigation, students will also understand the impact the selected societal issue has on society and develop possible responses and recommendations to address the issue.

Our Secondary Three students will embark on the Issue Investigation project in which they will collaborate with their peers to investigate a societal issue in Singapore and provide feedback to the government regarding issues they are concerned about. The investigation is designed to deepen their understanding of societal issues in Singapore through examining the issues critically by examining various perspectives. This is a great opportunity for students to practise and strengthen their writing skills and learn to respond constructively to societal issues as informed, concerned and participative citizens.  

**Principles of Accounts (POA)** <br> 
Principles of Accounts provide students with knowledge on business accounting principles and processes and is grounded in communicating and appreciating the need for ethical conduct in real-world situations. Students have participated in competitions such as the Build Your Own Business (BYOB) Digital Challenge and Financial Literacy for Youth (FLY) Challenge organised by the Republic Polytechnic and have done well in garnering accolades that include the proposal to manage Hawker Business.
