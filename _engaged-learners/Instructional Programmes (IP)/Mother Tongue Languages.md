**Department Overview** <br>
The vision of the department is to develop our students to be confident user of their Mother Tongue languages who have a deep appreciation of their ethnic cultures and values.

The MTL curriculum of the school is developed from MOE “Active learner, Proficient user” curriculum framework. Its strength lies in using an emphasis in using new technologies and tools to help students learn more effectively and enthusiastically. We also include cultural appreciation activities (eg MTL fortnights) to ensure students are always in touch with their own cultures and roots.

**Enrichment Programmes** <br>
**(1) Conversational Chinese/Malay (CCM) Programme** <br>
The aims of this programme are to strengthen Singapore’s multiracial compact and engender multiculturalism through an active and engaging approach that enables students to have some grounding of functional CL/ML so that they could more easily pick up the language should they need it for economic or other reasons in adult life. Most students found this programme useful in their daily life when communicating with their friends and neighbours. Students who went on Overseas Immersion Trip often impressed the locals with their ability to speak in CL/ML, which is not their MTL.

**(2) Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)** <br>
The programme provides opportunities for students to be exposed to the Mother Tongue language related performances in a theatre or an external setting. This enriching learning experience allowed students to reflect and debate on contemporary or societal issues that was often represented during such performances.

**(3) Author-in-Residence Programme (CL)** <br> 
Selected Sec 2 CL students will participate in this programme where students will receive guidance in their writing from a local Chinese author. Outstanding literary work by these students were published by Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL).

**(4) Learning Journeys** <br>
Learning journeys are organised to expose our students to their ethnic cultures as well as to promote greater interest in the learning of Mother Tongue languages.

**(5) Student-initiated learning activities** <br>
The Upper Sec Malay students were guided to run fun and engaging activities for Lower Sec Malay students. They conceptualized the plan and conducted traditional games for students to play.

**(6) Competitions** <br>
Our students had participated in various competitions and many returned with not just awards but gained valuable exoerience. Some competitions we had participated included National Chinese Challenge, Filming Competitions as well as zonal Tamil language competitions. The school also hosted our internal competitions such as Singing Competition to unleash the potential and pique the interest of our students.
