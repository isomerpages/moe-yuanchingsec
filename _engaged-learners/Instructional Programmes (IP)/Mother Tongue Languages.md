<p><strong>Department Overview</strong>
<br>The vision of the department is to develop our students to be confident
users of their Mother Tongue languages who have a deep appreciation of
their ethnic cultures and values.</p>
<p>The MTL curriculum of the school is developed from MOE “Joyful Learning,
Proficient user” curriculum framework. Its strength lies in using an emphasis
in using new technologies and tools to help students learn more effectively
and enthusiastically. We also include cultural appreciation activities
(eg MTL fortnights) to ensure students are always in touch with their own
cultures and roots.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment Programmes</strong>
<br><strong>(1) Conversational Chinese/Malay (CCM) Programme</strong>
<br>The aims of this programme are to strengthen Singapore’s multiracial compact
and engender multiculturalism through an active and engaging approach that
enables students to have some grounding of functional CL/ML so that they
could more easily pick up the language should they need it for economic
or other reasons in adult life. Most students found this programme useful
in their daily life when communicating with their friends and neighbours.
Students who went on Overseas Immersion Trip often impressed the locals
with their ability to speak in CL/ML, which is not their MTL.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong>
<br>The programme provides opportunities for students to be exposed to the
Mother Tongue language related performances in a theatre or an external
setting. This enriching learning experience allowed students to reflect
and debate on contemporary or societal issues that was often represented
during such performances.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Author-in-Residence Programme (CL)</strong>
<br>Selected Sec 2 CL students will participate in this programme where students
will receive guidance in their writing from a local Chinese author. Outstanding
literary work by these students were published by Committee to Promote
Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL).</p>
<p><strong>(4) Learning Journeys</strong>
<br>Learning journeys are organised to expose our students to their ethnic
cultures as well as to promote greater interest in the learning of Mother
Tongue languages.</p>
<p><strong>(5) Student-initiated learning activities</strong>
<br>The Upper Sec Malay students were guided to run fun and engaging activities
for Lower Sec Malay students. They conceptualized the plan and conducted
traditional games for students to play.</p>
<p><strong>(6) Competitions</strong>
<br>Our students had participated in various competitions and many returned
with not just awards but gained valuable exoerience. Some competitions
we had participated included National Chinese Challenge, Filming Competitions
as well as zonal Tamil language competitions. The school also hosted our
internal competitions such as Singing Competition to unleash the potential
and pique the interest of our students.</p>
