### Key Programmes

**Department Overview**

**Introduction:** <Br>
The PE Department of Yuan Ching Secondary School identifies and implements innovative changes that positively affect the school and the community. We are trailblazers and futurists who exemplify the spirit of innovation in the development of our educational approaches with strong work ethics, creativity, foresight and the use of technology to achieve developmental excellence.

**Department Vision:** To enable YCSians demonstrate the physical skills, practices, and schools values (IExCEL) to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

The PE Department aims to enable YCSians demonstrate the physical skills, practices, and schools values (IExCEL) to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. The PE curriculum in Yuan Ching is designed to develop in our students the ability to demonstrate their skills and values across a variety of sports and in outdoor education, provide them with authentic situations where they can apply what they have learnt so that they can be confident participants and responsible citizens in the future.

In 2020 and 2021, PE lessons were impacted due to the Covid-19 situation. During the circuit breaker period, students attended lessons through Home Based Learning (HBL) and PE lessons were conducted through Student Learning Space (SLS) and Google Classrooms. Students were tasked to keep themselves physically active by challenging themselves to do fitness conditioning at home periodically. Also, Outdoor Education lessons and game concept applications were conducted through SLS to elicit responses and assess students for understanding.

Post circuit breaker, PE lessons continued with Safety Management Measures in place. With these restrictions, the objectives of PE lessons were mainly to keep students active and also make purposeful connections between students’ learning experience and what they can relate to in the current situation. PE teachers reinforced Physical Health and Fitness content during this period and the importance of staying active and being socially responsible to the people around them. Fitness conditioning with safe distancing and small-sided games with safety measures were organised in order to keep students active.

Despite all the adversities COVID-19 situation and changing education landscape have presented to us, the learning of our students is not hampered as different possibilities presented itself in alternative ways. For instance, our students had the opportunity to engage in virtual runs, virtual dialogues with athletes of various sports, sports scientist, practitioners and even home fitness challenges.

The Physical Education Programme in Yuan Ching Secondary School builds on the foundation of quality movement laid at the primary school level. The students’ mature performance is enhanced across different specialised situations and physical activities, so that students become competent and enthusiastic participants.

Yuan Ching Secondary School offers six different physical activities. In these physical activities offered by the school, students will be provided with instruction and the opportunity to participate competently. They should also be able to carry out the physical activities independently and safely on their own beyond school.
