<p><strong>Department Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Department Vision</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>reative <strong>T</strong>hinkers , <strong>C</strong>oncerned <strong>C</strong>itizens</p>
<p><strong>Department Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>To inculcate creativity in our learners through engaging hands-on learning
in Art, Design and Technology, Music &amp; Food and Consumer Education.&nbsp;
We hope that the knowledge and skills learnt can inspire our students to
continuously think and seek creative ways to improve the overall quality
of life in their community as concerned citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2022 - The Start of Farm to Fork Concept</strong>
</p>
<p>With an aim to develop our students to become concerned citizens, as well
as to build a stronger sense of belonging to Yuan Ching Secondary School,
our department collaborated with Environmental Science Club teachers and
students to embark on our journey in sustainability. The Singapore Green
Plan 30 by 30 can only be achieved if there is collective effort from schools
and communities.</p>
<p>The Farm to Fork concept finally started its inception in Yuan Ching Secondary
School in 2022. The fully automated solar powered hydroponics system was
set up on 28 April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This hydroponics project would allow our students and staff to experience
sowing the efforts to grow the vegetables today and harvesting the vegetables
as the rewards for tomorrow which is also in line with Yuan Ching’s motto:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Efforts Today, Rewards Tomorrow”; “今日耕耘，明日长青”.</p>

<p><strong>2023 - Strengthening Farm to Fork Concept Through a Cross Disciplinary Project</strong>
<br>The department is going to start a cross disciplinary integrated project
known as ‘Farm to Fork’, incorporating the designing of a plant holder
for hydroponics. Stay tuned for more exciting updates and photos.

</p>
<p><strong>Art&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Art is an important and treasured mode of human expression throughout
history. Art plays many important roles in our lives. It captures memories,
communicates ideas, shapes values and evoke emotions. It exists all around
us in different forms; from the colours, shapes and patterns in nature
to everyday images and designs on magazines, products and media. As an
academic subject in the school curriculum, art is integral to the holistic
development of every student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In lower secondary, we have the principle of design and elements of design
with incorporation of inquiry based learning using both digital art as
well as traditional art form such as art making and art discussion. &nbsp;
The development of the different types of strategies to teach art in an
engaging way to develop their metacognition is the cornerstone of teaching
and learning of art. &nbsp; The use of the thinking routines and the use
of questioning techniques enable students to discover their understanding
of their own creativity and ability to create content that shows originality
and critical and inventive thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In upper secondary, the content taught is wide and deep with greater emphasis
in the inquiry based learning and artist reference.&nbsp; The ability to
gather and investigate on a given theme or concept and the application
of the skills in the different media is key to further develop teaching
and learning at the upper secondary level. Students reflect on their work
and also be a critic for other students' works so that the narrative for
collaborative learning is engrained deeper.</p>
<p>Apart from lessons in the classroom, students also take part in SYF Art
Exhibitions, external art competitions as well as learning journeys to
develop an understanding of best practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<br><strong>D&amp;T</strong>
</p>
<p>In D&amp;T, pupils learn mainly through design-and-make projects guided
by a design process. The design process entails identifying design needs
from real-world experiences, generating and developing ideas, and realising
the design solution; with research carried out when necessary. Research
includes testing ideas through quick mock-ups and evaluating the final
design solution with the intended user. In doing so, pupils acquire related
knowledge and develop skills that turn ideas into reality and values like
mindfulness, empathy and sensitivity in the areas of social, culture and
environment.</p>
<p>In lower secondary, students will learn various design techniques to generate
the designs of prototypes. During the course, students will learn to handle
various hand-tools and electrical machines so that they can make or realize
the prototypes in the workshop. Students will also acquire basic knowledge
of technology on electronics and mechanisms.</p>
<p>In upper secondary, students who are offered the Design &amp; Technology
course will dive deeper into the area of technologies. Students will be
engaged in creating more creative products by applying what they have learnt
in design techniques and technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>FCE/NFS</strong>
</p>
<p>FCE in the 21st century is designed with the social and economic landscape
of Singapore in mind, both current and future. The syllabus takes into
consideration new lifestyles and consumer trends, and therefore, the knowledge,
skills and attitudes required of young learners related to health and financial
management. In this syllabus, there are two Core Areas of Study that students
need to learn: Food Studies and Consumer Studies.</p>
<p>In lower secondary, students will go through an Applied Module to modify
and prepare Mac and Cheese with a local heritage twist that can be sold
in a local food court to attract tourist. Students will also explore using&nbsp;
different ingredients in cupcake making, then proceed to creating a nutritional
label to inform consumers of the nutritional content in the cupcake.</p>
<p>In upper secondary, students who are offered the Nutrition and Food Science
subject will be engaged in creating more skillful and creative dishes by
applying the food science content.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Music&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The syllabus is developed on the premise that all children are musical
and have the innate ability to listen, sing, dance, play and express themselves
musically. When learning experiences are tailored to develop children’s
musical abilities, the complete musicians inside them begin to emerge .
In addition, music has the potential to develop extra-musical skills, including
critical thinking skills, psychomotor skills, social awareness, and moral
and cultural values, all of which contribute to the holistic development
of a child.</p>
<p>In lower secondary, students will be exposed to various local and global
music. Students will also be involved in active listening, analysing and
responding to music of various cultures and styles in many ways. They will
also learn to improvise with voice and instruments and eventually engage
in composing or arranging a short music of a few parts using GarageBand
app</p>
