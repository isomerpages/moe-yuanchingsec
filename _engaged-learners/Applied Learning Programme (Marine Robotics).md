<h3>APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME</h3>
<p><strong>Charting New Horizons: Yuan Ching Secondary’s Applied Learning Programme in STEM and Marine Robotics</strong>
</p>
<p>At Yuan Ching Secondary, we believe in igniting curiosity, sparking innovation,
and preparing every student to thrive in a tech-driven world. Our Applied
Learning Programme (ALP) offers a unique, tiered approach that immerses
students in exciting, hands-on learning through Marine Robotics, environmental
science, and cutting-edge technology. With a focus on real-world applications,
the ALP empowers students to explore, invent, and excel, building confidence
and skills for the future.</p>
<p><strong><u>Tier 1: ALP for All Students – A Foundation in Innovation and Teamwork</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our Tier 1 ALP is designed for every Yuan Ching student, encouraging exploration
and skill-building through hands-on projects and collaborative learning.</p>
<p><strong>Marine Robotics (Sec 1)</strong>
<br>Imagine designing and building your very own underwater robot! In Secondary
1, students dive into Marine Robotics, crafting “Seaperches” through a
structured design-thinking process. Working in teams, they tackle challenges,
brainstorm creative solutions, and refine their designs, building teamwork
and communication skills with every step. Sharing their work with classmates
adds an extra layer of excitement and pride!</p>
<p><strong>Coding and Computational Thinking (Sec 2)</strong>
<br>In Secondary 2, students advance to learning computational thinking through
coding. The ALP curriculum is centered around the theme of transportation—land,
water, and air—enabling students to explore the ways coding is used in
modern industries. They also learn about AI technology by coding an AI
camera, appreciating how AI transforms sectors like transportation. Through
hands-on experiences with drone technology, 3D modeling, and 3D printing,
students gain a practical understanding of how technology shapes the world.</p>
<p><strong>Interdisciplinary Geography-Science Exploration with “Senseperches” (Sec 1-2)</strong>
<br>In this interdisciplinary project, students transform their Seaperches
into “Senseperches” by mounting them with sensors to monitor water quality
at Jurong Lake Gardens. They use the data collected as part of their geographical
investigation fieldwork, conducting an authentic study on environmental
health. This outdoor learning experience brings classroom theories to life,
helping students gain a deeper appreciation of environmental stewardship.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Science and Data Analysis (Sec 2)</strong>
<br>Launched in 2024, our newest interdisciplinary program combines environmental
science with data analysis. Students use temperature and humidity sensors
to monitor their microgreens growth project, reinforcing the scientific
methods of data collection, analysis, and hypothesis-making taught in science
lessons. Through this hands-on approach, students become budding scientists,
learning that science is not only about answers—it’s about asking the right
questions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Tier 2: Talent Development Programme – Fueling the Passionate and Driven</u></strong>
</p>
<p>For students with a deeper interest in STEM, Tier 2 offers a tailored
Talent Development Programme where they <strong>Explore, Pursue, and Excel</strong> in
their passion areas, gaining experience that goes beyond the basics.</p>
<p><strong>Explore</strong>
<br>Through modules in 3D drawing and modeling, along with thrilling learning
journeys like the <strong>IMDEX International Marine Trade Show</strong> and
the <strong>Singapore Airshow</strong>, students gain valuable exposure
to the high-tech world of marine, aviation, and technology industries.</p>
<p><strong>Pursue</strong>
<br>Students then advance their skills through enrichment courses in <strong>Python programming, drones, and app development</strong>.
With Applied Learning Modules (what is the acronym?), they dig deeper into
STEM, honing practical skills that mirror industry needs and expanding
their knowledge with each new discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Excel</strong>
<br>At the pinnacle of their ALP journey, students participate in competitions
such as the <strong>NP Offshore and Sustainable Engineering Challenge</strong> and
the <strong>Science Centre Drone Odyssey</strong>. Termly meetups allow
these young innovators to share their work, inspire each other, and embark
on new learning adventures together. By the end, they walk away with an
impressive portfolio showcasing the projects, skills, and insights they’ve
gained over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering a New Generation of Innovators</strong>
</p>
<p>Through ALP, Yuan Ching Secondary offers students more than an education—we
offer them the thrill of discovery, the confidence to explore, and the
skills to create. Whether they pursue STEM as a career or simply gain a
lifelong appreciation for science and technology, our students leave Yuan
Ching empowered to shape the future.</p>
