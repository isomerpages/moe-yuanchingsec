<h3>APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME</h3>
<p>Our school embarked on Applied Learning Programme (ALP) with the focus
on Marine Robotics in 2016. Our ALP (Marine Robotics) programme connects
the knowledge and scientific thinking skills our students learn in the
classroom to related real world contexts as we navigate the future of transportation.
This programme seeks to deepen our students’ interest and passion in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) while providing the opportunity
to learn life skills, values and competencies to apply their knowledge
in the real world context.</p>
<p>Starting from lower secondary levels, our students will acquire the essential
skills in scientific thinking and design thinking, and apply them with
their knowledge in Science, Maths and Design and Technology in the Marine
Robotics programme. Working in teams, our students are engaged in active
collaboration, critical and creative thinking to ideate and design prototypes
while communicating their ideas and design proposals. Students are equipped
with coding knowledge which broadens their perspectives and provides them
with a good understanding of the working principles of microprocessors
and sensors. The concepts in these lessons come alive with the integrated
application of STEM knowledge and coding into the sensors of surface and
underwater vehicles that students in their teams design and build to overcome
designated water challenges.</p>

<p>Students who are keen to stretch their potential in the field of Marine
Robotics will embark on a Talent Development Programme in ALP, which deepens
their understanding of advanced topics in the area of STEM while expanding
their horizons through related learning journeys and collaborations with
our industry partners such as Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore
(MPA), Singapore Maritime Foundation (SMF) and Singapore Shipping Association
(SSA). Through these activities, our students gain a better understanding
of Singapore maritime history and better appreciate the current and future
impact of the maritime industry on Singapore’s economy.</p>
<p>Our ALP programme also empowers students to take ownership of their learning
and provides autonomy for students to decide on their own specialised training
programme. The school houses the Tech Alley, a tinkering space for students
to carry out self-exploration of coding and other STEM-related projects.
The Tech Alley is also equipped with 3D printers and other equipment to
support the students in their tinkering journey. Students are further challenged
to excel in the field of STEM by participating in various inter-school
competitions such as the annual Shell Challenge organised by the Singapore
Science Centre, Underwater Robotics Olympiad and Marine &amp; Offshore
Challenge organised by Polytechnics. The school also works closely with
National University of Singapore to deepen our students’ knowledge in autonomous
underwater systems. To reinforce their learning through these experiences,
the students will document their products, learning points and reflections
in an online e-portfolio, where opportunities will also be provided for
students to share their learning at school level.</p>
