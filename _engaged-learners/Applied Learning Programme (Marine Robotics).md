### APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME

Our school embarked on Applied Learning Programme (ALP) with the focus on Marine Robotics in 2016. Our ALP (Marine Robotics) programme connects the knowledge and scientific thinking skills our students learn in the classroom to related real world contexts as we navigate the future of transportation. This programme seeks to deepen our students’ interest and passion in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) while providing the opportunity to learn life skills, values and competencies to apply their knowledge in the real world context. 


Starting from lower secondary levels, our students will acquire the essential skills in scientific thinking and design thinking, and apply them with their knowledge in Science, Maths and Design and Technology in the Marine Robotics programme. Working in teams, our students are engaged in active collaboration, critical and creative thinking to ideate and design prototypes while communicating their ideas and design proposals. Students are equipped with coding knowledge which broadens their perspectives and provides them with a good understanding of the working principles of microprocessors and sensors. The concepts in these lessons come alive with the integrated application of STEM knowledge and coding into the sensors of surface and underwater vehicles that students in their teams design and build to overcome designated water challenges.

Students who are keen to stretch their potential in the field of Marine Robotics will embark on a Talent Development Programme in ALP, which deepens their understanding of advanced topics in the area of STEM while expanding their horizons through related learning journeys and collaborations with our industry partners such as Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Singapore Maritime Foundation (SMF) and Singapore Shipping Association (SSA). Through these activities, our students gain a better understanding of Singapore maritime history and better appreciate the current and future impact of the maritime industry on Singapore’s economy.

Our ALP programme also empowers students to take ownership of their learning and provides autonomy for students to decide on their own specialised training programme. The school houses the Tech Alley, a tinkering space for students to carry out self-exploration of coding and other STEM-related projects. Students are further challenged to excel in the field of STEM by participating in various inter-school competitions such as the annual Shell Challenge organised by the Singapore Science Centre, Underwater Robotics Olympiad and Marine &amp; Offshore Challenge organised by Polytechnics. The school also works closely with National University of Singapore to deepen our students’ knowledge in autonomous underwater systems. To reinforce their learning through these experiences, the students will document their products, learning points and reflections in an online e-portfolio, where opportunities will also be provided for students to share their learning at school level.
