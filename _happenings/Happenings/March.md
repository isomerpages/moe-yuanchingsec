### Partners Summit<br>

At last week’s Committee of Supply debates, MOE announced plans to support its Learn for Life movement. The school’s Partners Summit was a wonderful opportunity for our students to build future-ready competencies. Serving as table facilitators and scribes, student councillors had to listen with understanding, write with accuracy, speak clearly and reply coherently to a table of adults for almost 1 hour, and without any intervention by teachers. They were confident and made a strong impression with the SAC, parents, alumni and industry reps. This is a very authentic learning opportunity, whereby students apply their language skills and at the same time, develop 21st CC of Communication and Information Skills. EL Department should consider giving these students an exemption from one future WA that is focused on Listening and Oral Comprehension!
