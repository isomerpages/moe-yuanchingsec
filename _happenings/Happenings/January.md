### Sec 1 Orientation <br>


School has begun and we have started with a bang!

We welcomed our Secondary 1 students yesterday and they are in the midst of an exciting Orientation.

We also did not forget our Secondary 3 students who have entered a new phase! We welcomed them back to school with our signature Secondary 3 Orientation.

Let us continue to build strong bonds and make wonderful memories in 2023 as one Yuan Ching!
