Over the course of 2 months, 2 students (Wattana Lim from 3 Loyalty and Ashton Chen from 2 Loyalty) from Yuan Ching Secondary School participated in the game making and animation competition organised by MOE Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD).   

Out of the 84 schools which have participated, we are pleased to announce that Ashton Chen has obtained the silver award in the animation category. Wattana Lim has also obtained a certificate of participation. 

We would like to thank their CPA teachers Mr Lai Weng Keong, Mdm Chai Jiamin, Mdm Shanthy and Ms Kelly Tan for their support and guidance to these students during this period. We would also like to thank the school leaders for promoting such competitions for the development of the students.
