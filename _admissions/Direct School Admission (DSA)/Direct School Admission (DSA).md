<h3>Direct School Admission (DSA)</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides
students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school,
based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements
and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE).</p>
<p></p>
<p>For Direct School Admission, Yuan Ching Secondary School is pleased to
offer the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/stem-engineering-innovation-and-solutions/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">STEM: Engineering Innovation and Solutions</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/ycss-dsa-community-and-youth-leadership/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Leadership: Community Youth Leadership</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.&nbsp;</p>
