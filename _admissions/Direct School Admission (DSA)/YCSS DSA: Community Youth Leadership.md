<p>Students passionate about leadership and community service are welcome
to apply for admission to Yuan Ching Secondary School through the DSA-CYL
track. Applicants will be assessed based on their potential, passion, and
alignment with CYL values, rather than prior experience alone. Successful
applicants will experience Tiers 2 and 3 of the school's <a href="/confident-leaders/learning-for-life-programme/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Life-Long Learning Programme.</a> 
</p>
<p>DSA students are expected to actively take on leadership roles during
their time at YCSS and contribute meaningfully to the school and wider
community through the CYL programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment</strong>
</p>
<p>At Yuan Ching Secondary School, leadership is more than a title. We believe
it is a lifelong journey of character, service, and purpose. Through Community
Youth Leadership, we empower every student to rise, lead and elevate as
they inspire positive change in their own lives and in the world around
them.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders Aren’t Born. They Show Up. Like You!</strong>
</p>
<p>At Yuan Ching, we believe that leadership is not something you are born
with. We believe that it is something you choose, nurture, and grow. If
you are ready to serve, to lead, and to make a difference, you already
have what it takes.</p>
<p>Join us, and let’s shape the future together.</p>

<p>Students who have relevant school portfolios (e.g., participation in student
leadership bodies, VIA projects, or community service), awards (EAGLES
and ECHA) and personal experiences are encouraged to present them. However,
the absence of a portfolio will not disadvantage applicants, as the selection
process focuses on potential, attitude, and alignment with CYL values.</p>
<p>Please also take note that meeting all the criteria does not guarantee
the student will be shortlisted/given an offer.</p>
<p>Applicants who do not have prior experience may also apply. The school
will assess applicants based on the selection criteria, which may include
assessing the potential of the applicants.</p>
