<p>Through the development opportunities provided, students admitted through
DSA would build strong technical knowledge, perseverance and creativity,
laying the foundations for you to pursue engineering and related fields
in post-secondary institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This early commitment helps students build confidence, resilience, and
technical expertise, laying the groundwork for future STEM-related studies
and careers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At every stage — whether exploring how a boat floats, building a drone
from scratch, or programming an autonomous robot — our ALP provides a safe
space for students to experiment, take risks, and grow.</p>
