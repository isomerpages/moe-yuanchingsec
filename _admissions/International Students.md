International students who wish to seek admission to a MOE Secondary School (Secondary 1 to 3 levels) in the following academic year are required to sit for and pass the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS) administered by the Ministry of Education at about September each year. The AEIS comprises centralised tests on English and Mathematics to assess the applicant’s English literacy, numeracy and reasoning abilities. Admission is not guaranteed and is subject to applicant’s performance in the tests. If successful, placement will depend on available vacancies and the applicant’s declared residential area in Singapore.
