Singaporean students (Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents) returning from living and studying overseas who wish to seek admission to a MOE Secondary School (Secondary 1 to 3 levels) at the beginning of the next academic year, may apply to participate in the School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans – Secondary (SPERS-Sec). SPERS-Sec is a centralised placement exercise administered by the Ministry of Education at about September each year for Returning Singaporeans. Application is through the online SPERS-SEC portal that is opened typically from July to August period each year.

Should students be unable to take the School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans – Secondary (SPERS-Sec) that typically takes place in September, they may participate in the Supplementary Placement Exercise (SPE).
