<h3>Direct School Admission (DSA): STEM - Robotics</h3>
<h3>1. Background</h3>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides
students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school,
based on a diverse range of specific and non-academic achievements and
talents that they can demonstrate beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination
(PSLE).</p>
<p>For 2024, Yuan Ching Secondary School will offer Secondary One places
to aspiring students with the strong desire to be developed under one of
our distinctive programmes - Applied Learning Programme (ALP). Our ALP
is in the category of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(Stem), focusing on Marine Robotics.</p>
<p>More information on our ALP can be found through the following link:
