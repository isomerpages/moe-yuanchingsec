**USE OF CALCULATORS AND DICTIONARIES DURING EXAMINATIONS**

All students must ensure that they are using approved calculators and/or dictionaries for all examinations. Students who are found with unauthorized calculators/dictionaries during the school/national examination would have violated an examination regulation and actions would be taken against them.
