However, if the school has not contacted you by 27 Dec 2024, please contact
the school to enquire.</p>

<h5><strong>Step 4: Sale of Books and Uniform</strong><br></h5>
<p>You may access the website from <strong><u>18 Dec – 24 Dec 2024</u></strong> to
purchase the books and uniform online to avoid queuing in the school. There
will be 2 options of purchases – Home delivery (with a delivery charge)
and Self-collection via the website at&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.pacificbookstores.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Please refer&nbsp;the above website under <strong>FAQs</strong>&nbsp;for
the guide on how to purchase your books and uniform online.</p>
<p>You may still walk in to purchase the books and uniform at the school
bookshop from <strong>19 Dec to 30 Dec 2024 (Weekday: 9am – 3pm, Sat: 9am – 12pm) </strong>but
do expect to queue up for the purchases. <strong>Note:</strong> The bookshop
will be closed on <u>24 Dec and 28 Dec 2024</u>.</p>
<p>For students offered More Demanding Level subjects under&nbsp;<strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL)</strong>,
you would need to confirm the subjects that you will be taking before purchasing
the books. If you are not sure, do not purchase the books. You can still
purchase the books after school starts on 2 Jan 2025.</p>
<p>For FAS students, you can only collect the books and uniform after receiving
the FAS Approval Letter from the school. Please <strong><u>do not</u></strong> buy
the books on your own as there will be<strong>&nbsp;NO refund</strong>&nbsp;if
you do so.</p>

<h5><strong>Step 5: Purchase of Personal Learning Device</strong><br></h5>
