_The tree’s broad trunk and deep roots symbolise the strong foundation of the PSG. The branches and leaves on the tree show how vibrant and fun the PSG activities are. At the heart of the tree, the PSG is a loving, compassionate and caring community. As the leaves and branches encompass the heart, the parent, the child and the educator are working in harmony. The PSG tree is growing, in its evergreen pasture of Yuan Ching Secondary School._
