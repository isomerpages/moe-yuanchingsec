Dear Parents/Guardians,  
  
To provide added support for all secondary students on MOE FAS during this circuit breaker period, MOE, with support from the Sayang Sayang Fund by the Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS), will now extend meal subsidies to MOE FAS students whether or not they return to school during full HBL.  
  
The provision will apply for a period of four weeks, covering the full HBL period. School will credit four weeks of meal subsidies via students’ School Smartcard. Secondary school students on MOE FAS will receive $120 each.  
  
The School Smartcard can be used to purchase food and essential groceries at some hawker centres, food courts, minimarts, convenience stores and supermarkets. Students can redeem the extended meal subsidies at any TransitLink Add Value Machine once every two weeks, starting from 14 April 2020.  
  
  
Warm regards,  
Ms Ng Sook Kit  
Principal
