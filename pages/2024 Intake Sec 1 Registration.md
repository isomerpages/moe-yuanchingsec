Welcome to Yuan Ching! By joining us, you made the right decision to embark you child/ward on a journey towards life-long learning that will eventually lead to success! Congratulations!

We aim to provide your child/ward with a learner-centric and values-driven education that nurtures holistic development. This is encapsulated in our School Mission of 'Enriching Minds, Unleashing Potential, Impacting Lives' and our School Vision of developing every student to be 'A Thinker, an Achiever, and a Concerned Citizen'.

Anchoring our mission and vision is our school values which we uphold and enact through the lenses of a positive education and mental resilience. Our Total Curriculum is guided by the principles of being Inclusive,&nbsp;Experiential,&nbsp;Contemporary,&nbsp;E\-enabled and one that inculcates a&nbsp;Life-long learning mindset (I ExCEL)

  

It is our belief that the potential of every child is best realised with the strong support and active partnership of parents/guardians. We strongly encourage parents to join our Parent Support Group (PSG) and the Positive Parenting Programme (PPP) so that we can nurture our learners in the best way possible, together hand-in-hand.

To welcome your child/ward and to induct him/her into the new Yuan Ching family, our teachers and student leaders have been working hard to put together a&nbsp;Sec 1 Orientation Programme from 4 to 6 Jan 2022 (Tues to Thu), followed by a&nbsp;virtual campfire on 7 Jan 2022 (Fri) ending at 5.30pm.&nbsp;Lunch will be provided for the students. There will be a CCA showcase on 4, 6 and 7 Jan 2022 in the afternoon for students to learn about the various CCAs in Yuan Ching.

Basic information on our school and details of school programmes is available on the school’s website and also in the&nbsp;2023 Student Handbook &amp; Planner&nbsp;which is specially curated for your child. It will be issued to your child/ward during the Sec 1 Orientation.

We will meet you virtually on&nbsp;8 Jan 2022 (Sat) at 9.00am&nbsp;to share with you more about Yuan Ching during the Principal’s Address. We look forward to a meaningful and fruitful partnership with you in the years ahead.

  
Thank you

Ms. Ng Sook Kit

Principal
