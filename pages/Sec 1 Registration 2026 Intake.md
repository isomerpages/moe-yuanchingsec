<h3><strong>Welcome Message from our Student Development Team for Students</strong></h3>
<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have made it through PSLE and earned your spot at
Yuan Ching Secondary School. We are genuinely thrilled to have you joining
our school community!</p>
<p>Right now, you are probably wondering what secondary school will be like.
Maybe you are excited about the new adventure, or perhaps a bit worried
about fitting in and keeping up. Both feelings are totally understandable,
and honestly, most students feel the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong>
</p>
<p>Your seniors on the Student Council have been busy planning something
special for you. From 2nd to 7th January 2026, they will be running orientation
activities to help you settle in. Think of it as your crash course in becoming
a Yuan Ching student. You will figure out how to navigate the school (trust
us, you won't get lost forever), meet your classmates, and start building
friendships that could last through secondary school and beyond.</p>
<p>Then, on 10<sup>th</sup> January 2026 (Saturday), come check out our CCA
showcase! This is where you will discover the activities that spark your
interest. Whether you are into sports and games, visual and performing
arts, clubs and societies, or uniformed groups, there is something here
for you!</p>
<p><strong>The Secondary School Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>With Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB), you will be learning in classes
that match your strengths and learning style. You will also get to take
charge of your own learning on Blended Learning days.</p>
<p>You will receive your very own iPad through the Personalised Digital Learning
Programme (PDLP), a tool for learning, research, teamwork and maybe a quick
game during your breaks (we won’t tell).</p>
<p>Get ready for some new subjects too: History, Geography, English Literature,
Food &amp; Consumer Education, and Design &amp; Technology. This is not
extra work. They are chances to explore different ways of thinking and
maybe discover a passion you never knew you had.</p>
<p><strong>What We Hope for You</strong>
</p>
<p>We have one main hope for your Secondary 1 year: ‘<strong>Try Everything!</strong>’
Don't hold back because you think you might not be good at something. This
is your time to experiment, make mistakes, learn from them, and grow.</p>
<p>Secondary school can feel like a big leap from primary school, and some
days might be tougher than others. That's when you remember you are part
of the Yuan Ching family now. We've got your back. Our school motto, ‘<strong>Efforts Today, Rewards Tomorrow</strong>,’
isn't just words on a wall. It's a reminder that the work you put in now
will pay off in ways you might not even imagine yet.</p>
<p>As you begin your journey with us, we also hope you will grow into our
school’s vision of becoming ‘<strong>A Thinker, an Achiever, and Concerned Citizen’</strong>.
Through your experiences here, we want to nurture in you the qualities
of a <strong>Critical Thinker</strong> who asks good questions, a <strong>Resilient Learner</strong> who
does not give up when challenges come your way, and a <strong>Compassionate Contributor</strong> who
cares for others and makes a positive impact.</p>
<p>Looking forward to meeting each of you on 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2026.
Let's make this year count!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p></p>
