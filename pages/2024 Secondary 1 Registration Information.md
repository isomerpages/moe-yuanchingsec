<p style="text-align: justify;">The first week of school will be an exciting one. Our Student Council has planned a week of orientation activities from 3 to 6 Jan 2023 especially for you. You will familiarise yourselves to the school environment and get to make new friends. There will also be a CCA showcase on 13 Jan to help you make an informed decision on your choice of CCA!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Secondary school, you will have more flexibility to practise self-directedness in planning and managing your learning, especially on Blended Learning days.
