**Commencement of eCCA sssions** <br>
Due to COVID-19, school programmes that involve inter-mingling of students between classes/schools, such as CCA meetings, remain suspended. In order to support students’ holistic development, Yuan Ching Secondary will be providing the delivery of CCA via digital means (eCCA). These allow essential elements of school activities to be retained, while allowing your child/ward to further develop their personal mastery of skills/craft or other holistic aspects at home. <br><br>
The attendance of your child/ward for the eCCA sessions is optional but highly encouraged. More details of eCCA will be provided on our school’s Home-Based Learning website starting from week 3. We thank you for your partnership in supporting the holistic growth of your child/ward.
