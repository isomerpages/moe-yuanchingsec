As part of emergency management to safeguard your child's health and that of all students and staff in the school, students are required to declare their travel plans for the upcoming holidays.

Please make declaration of your child's/ward's travel plan if your child/ward is travelling out of Singapore.  

Kindly declare any travel plans through the **Parents Gateway Mobile Application**.

1.  Download and install the latest version of Parents Gateway App v.5.0.0 for iOS and v5.0.1 for Android.

2.  Go to \[SERVICES > DECLARE TRAVELS\] to make your declaration.  

If you have more than 1 child, and the declarations details are the same, please select all of them and make only 1 declaration, even if they are in different schools.

You can also make a 'Not Travelling' declaration if necessary.

Only one parent is required to declare.

Click on this [link](/files/Travel%20Declaration%20User%20Guide%20for%20Parents%20Aug%202020.pdf) to access the step-by-step guide.

**Alternatively**, if you have no access to Parents Gateway Application, please click [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5c77443ab672fa00173af821) to submit your child’s travel declaration or scan the **QR code** to access the form.

We seek the cooperation of parents/guardians to exercise social responsibilities by making accurate travel declaration.

Thank you for providing travel information to help the school to be prepared for travel safety and emergencies.
