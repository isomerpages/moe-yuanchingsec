<p>Dear Parents, Teachers, and Students of Yuan Ching Secondary,</p>
<p>First, joining the Yuan Ching Secondary family is truly an honour and
a privilege. Although I am new to the school, my association with Yuan
Ching dates back to the early 2000s. At that time, I was a newly appointed
school leader in a nearby school within the same cluster. The principal
was Mr. Chia Chor Yann, and the VP was Mr. Gomez. Yuan Ching Secondary
was then seen as a benchmark for many schools in the area, earning the
respect and admiration of school leaders, including myself. We were in
awe of YCSS’s academic excellence, dedication, and commitment to providing
a holistic curriculum firmly anchored in character education, values inculcation,
and inclusivity.</p>
<p>I am glad these qualities remain as vibrant in 2025 as they were back
then. In fact, they have strengthened over the years under the leadership
of exemplary principals such as Mrs. Saraspathy Menon, Mrs. Chuah-Koh Eng
Ngoh, and my predecessor, Ms. Ng Sook Kit.</p>
<p>Similarly, as in the past, the community continues to view YCSS as an
achieving school and a caring and disciplined one. From members of the
public to parents and alumni alike, I have heard many wonderful things
about the school, its students, its staff, and its culture of care. My
first few days here have affirmed what I have heard. The warmth of the
welcome extended by staff and students has been overwhelming. The smiles,
friendliness, and eagerness to share all about the school clearly reflect
the great sense of belonging and pride everyone feels for YCSS.</p>
<p>I am truly blessed to be part of such an amazing, close-knit, and vibrant
school community. I am eager to begin my journey with the YCSS family and
look forward to the exciting times we will share together in the near future.</p>
<p>Each new school year brings joy, excitement, and anticipation for all.
In 2025, I am confident that alongside new beginnings, the YCSS tradition
of making everyone who enters the school feel welcomed, cared for, valued,
and safe will continue. The school’s commitment to meeting the needs of
students and providing opportunities to explore and grow will remain steadfast.
YCSS will continue striving to provide the best for its students, enriching
their minds, unleashing their potential, and nurturing them into contributing
individuals who positively impact their communities. We will guide our
young ladies and gentlemen to be thinkers, achievers, and global citizens.</p>
<p>Of course, achieving this vision requires the support and cooperation
of all - parents, teachers, and students alike. A commitment to high standards
and expectations in academic performance, co-curricular participation,
behaviour, and discipline is essential for creating an exceptional learning
community where every individual finds the educational experience enriching,
enjoyable, and fulfilling.</p>
<p>As the new year begins, parents, teachers, and young ladies and gentlemen
of YCSS, let us join hands and journey forward with a shared heart, mind,
and direction. Together, we can bring YCSS to even greater heights.</p>
<p>Wishing all of you a wonderful school year.</p>
<p>Mr. Shawal Bin Hussin
<br>Principal
<br>"Efforts Today, Rewards Tomorrow"
