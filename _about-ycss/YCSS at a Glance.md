**Official Name: Yuan Ching Secondary School**

<u> Established: January 1978 </u>

Yuan Ching Secondary School started out as an English and Chinese integrated school and was officially opened by Mr Ho Kah Leong, MP for Jurong on 28 Aug 1980. It became an English medium school when the last batch of Chinese medium students graduated in 1987 and served as a pre-university centre that offered Arts and Commerce courses from 1988 to 1990. Mr Chou We Chuan, the founding principal, designed the school crest, penned the lyrics of the school song, and created the school motto.

The school was completely rebuilt with brand new buildings and facilities on the same site under MOE’s PRIME (Project for Renovating & Improving Existing Schools) from Jun 2006 to Dec 2008.

From her humble beginnings of 11 Sec 1 classes, 18 teaching staff and 11 non-teaching staff, the school has since flourished into a learner-centred learning environment with innovatively designed learning spaces, leveraging on network and learning technologies that facilitate self-directed learning and collaborative opportunities for our 1140 students, while showcasing students’ academic work, visual and performing arts.

The school’s approach to education is one that integrates collaboration and values to provide an enriching and holistic learning experience through designing interdisciplinary programmes, leveraging on the community for Values-in-Action projects and partners for work attachments. The culture of care is infused in our curriculum through our environmental sustainability programme that promotes recycling, upcycling and waste management effort while our sports education programmes featuring camps, water sports as well as activities for ParaSports inculcate resilience and inclusivity as Yuan Ching develops our students to be 'A Thinker, an Achiever and Concerned Citizen'.

**School Motto: Efforts Today, Rewards Tomorrow, is a translation from the Chinese version,  
“今日耕耘，明日长青”**

<u> Green Energy: </u><br>
Complementing the lush greenery of our school, the rooftops of the different blocks in the school are installed with 1540 solar panels where the photovoltaic systems generate 600,000 kWh of energy, which translates to an estimated 70% of energy consumption in the school being green energy.
