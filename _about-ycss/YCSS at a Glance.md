<p><strong>Official Name: Yuan Ching Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Established: January 1978</u>
</p>
<p>Yuan Ching Secondary School started out as an English and Chinese integrated
school and was officially opened by Mr Ho Kah Leong, MP for Jurong on 28
Aug 1980. It became an English medium school when the last batch of Chinese
medium students graduated in 1987 and served as a pre-university centre
that offered Arts and Commerce courses from 1988 to 1990. Mr Chou We Chuan,
the founding principal, designed the school crest, penned the lyrics of
the school song, and created the school motto.</p>

<p>The school was completely rebuilt with brand new buildings and facilities
on the same site under MOE’s PRIME (Project for Renovating &amp; Improving
Existing Schools) from Jun 2006 to Dec 2008.</p>
<p>From her humble beginnings of 11 Sec 1 classes, 18 teaching staff and
11 non-teaching staff, the school has since flourished into a learner-centred
learning environment with innovatively designed learning spaces, leveraging
on network and learning technologies that facilitate self-directed learning
and collaborative opportunities for our 1140 students, while showcasing
students’ academic work, visual and performing arts.</p>

<p>The school’s approach to education is one that integrates collaboration
and values to provide an enriching and holistic learning experience through
designing interdisciplinary programmes, leveraging on the community for
Values-in-Action projects and partners for work attachments. The culture
of care is infused in our curriculum through our environmental sustainability
programme that promotes recycling, upcycling and waste management effort
while our sports education programmes featuring camps, water sports as
well as activities for ParaSports inculcate resilience and inclusivity
as Yuan Ching develops our students to be 'A Thinker, an Achiever and Concerned
Citizen'.</p>
<p><strong>School Motto: Efforts Today, Rewards Tomorrow, is a translation from the Chinese version,<br>“今日耕耘，明日长青”</strong>

<p><strong><u>Green Energy: </u><br></strong>Complementing the lush greenery
of our school, the rooftops of the different blocks in the school are installed
with 1540 solar panels where the photovoltaic systems generate 600,000
kWh of energy, which translates to an estimated 70% of energy consumption
in the school being green energy.</p>
